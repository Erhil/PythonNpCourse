Negative:  I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer  |Positive:  Only the park outside of the hotel was beautiful 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  No real complaints the hotel was great great location surroundings rooms amenities and service Two recommendations however firstly the staff upon check in are very confusing regarding deposit payments and the staff offer you upon checkout to refund your original payment and you can make a new one Bit confusing Secondly the on site restaurant is a bit lacking very well thought out and excellent quality food for anyone of a vegetarian or vegan background but even a wrap or toasted sandwich option would be great Aside from those minor minor things fantastic spot and will be back when i return to Amsterdam 
Negative:  Rooms are nice but for elderly a bit difficult as most rooms are two story with narrow steps So ask for single level Inside the rooms are very very basic just tea coffee and boiler and no bar empty fridge  |Positive:  Location was good and staff were ok It is cute hotel the breakfast range is nice Will go back 
Negative:  My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep  |Positive:  Great location in nice surroundings the bar and restaurant are nice and have a lovely outdoor area The building also has quite some character 
Negative:  You When I booked with your company on line you showed me pictures of a room I thought I was getting and paying for and then when we arrived that s room was booked and the staff told me we could only book the villa suite theough them directly Which was completely false advertising After being there we realised that you have grouped lots of rooms on the photos together leaving me the consumer confused and extreamly disgruntled especially as its my my wife s 40th birthday present Please make your website more clear through pricing and photos as again I didn t really know what I was paying for and how much it had wnded up being Your photos told me I was getting something I wasn t Not happy and won t be using you again  |Positive:  Amazing location and building Romantic setting 
Negative:  Backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with 4 stars  |Positive:  Good restaurant with modern design great chill out place Great park nearby the hotel and awesome main stairs 
Negative:  Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it  |Positive:  The room is spacious and bright The hotel is located in a quiet and beautiful park 
Negative:  Apart from the price for the brekfast Everything very good |Positive:  Good location Set in a lovely park friendly staff Food high quality We Oth enjoyed the breakfast 
Negative:  Even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived Also check in is at 15 o clock but our room was not ready at that time |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night  |Positive:  The room was big enough and the bed is good The breakfast food and service on the hotel is good outside the hotel there is a big park which is very good for walk in the morning and evening Many people are having picnics and do some bicycling 
Negative:  Nothing all great  |Positive:  Rooms were stunningly decorated and really spacious in the top of the building Pictures are of room 300 The true beauty of the building has been kept but modernised brilliantly Also the bath was lovely and big and inviting Great more for couples Restaurant menu was a bit pricey but there were loads of little eatery places nearby within walking distance and the tram stop into the centre was about a 6 minute walk away and only about 3 or 4 stops from the centre of Amsterdam Would recommend this hotel to anyone it s unbelievably well priced too 
Negative:  6 30 AM started big noise workers loading wood down the windows Stupid room numbering system it took 20 Minutes with a night guard finally to find our rooms The check in staff pointed us in the wrong direction No late dinner bar closes at 1 am Ugly view on trash lorry from windows No information about the computerized telephone Huge price difference between booking Com price 166 euros and hotel price 260  |Positive:  Style location rooms
Negative:  The floor in my room was filfy dirty Very basic rooms I had a 20yr old tv in my room Fridge did not work Overpriced breakfast  |Positive:  Comfy bed good location 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This hotel is being renovated with great care and with an appreciation for its unique structure and location My spacious and comfortable room had a large double paned glass window onto the lush greenery of the park The breakfast selection was spectacular All considered this was a great hotel for the price and I plan to return 
Negative:  The staff in the restaurant could of been more pleasant we only visited once but that wouldn t stop us from booking again it might of just been an off night for him  |Positive:  It was very good very historic building that s why I chose it 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This hotel is awesome I took it sincirely because a bit cheaper but the structure seem in an hold church close to one awesome park Arrive in the city are like 10 minutes by tram and is super easy The hotel inside is awesome and really cool and the room is incredible nice with two floor and up one super big comfortable room I ll come back for sure there The staff very gentle one Spanish man really really good 
Negative:  Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse |Positive:  Great onsite cafe Amazing building Park location Amazing Bobby Gin and Tonic 
Negative:  We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment  |Positive:  We loved the location of this hotel The fact that it is set in a Park away from the busy centre of dam square was great The tram system was brilliant and easy to handle The hotel is lovely and the bed was comfy Staff were very friendly and helpful and familiarized themselves with us when they realized we travelled from Ireland 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Public areas are lovely and the room was nice but the window was broken and the drains in the bathroom smelt Its an old building and clearly has old building issues 
Negative:  We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely  |Positive:  I liked the hotels history And for such an enormous hotel I can t imagine how many girls were orphaned I liked their breakfast It was a quirky mix of fruits pastries meats and fish breads and the regular bacon and eggs Juices tea and coffee 
Negative:  Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit  |Positive:  Friendly staff OostPark a few yards away Good continental breakfast selection Quiet and relaxing area 
Negative:  Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery  |Positive:  The breakfast was the only positive element of this hotel original in taste and a good selection of selection of health food dishes on the buffet We did not try the restaurant but the whole set up with its view and terrace on the park is exceptional We had a wedding in the hotel s chapel so the convenience of just walking upstairs after the party was our reason of selecting this location 
Negative:  Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing  |Positive:  The location is good You need 15min to 20min walk to the center depends on your speed The hotel locates in a beautiful park and have a nice interior design The bed was really comfortable 
Negative:  Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner  |Positive:  Bed was extremely comfy and the staff where well spoken they also gave us all the help with easiest way to city centre and all the relevant transportation tickets and unique locations to visit will definitely be returning as this city is beautiful and the people are so friendly 
Negative:  Nothing  |Positive:  Lovely hotel with extremely comfortable huge double bed We stayed in the split level room which we really liked If you have difficulty getting up stairs request if you can stay in a room all on one level The Oosterpark is beautiful the shops and restaurants are great with lots of variety to choose from You can get the Metro close by 8min walk or the Tram is a short walk away and runs from the station and you can get off within a 5 mins walk to the Hotel All in all a beautiful hotel with friendly staff shampoo and soap in the shower Tea and coffee facilities in your room and in a location that is more relaxing than the central Amsterdam We will be returning 
Negative:  The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv  |Positive:  Great location in the park near museums and restaurants Perfect launch pad for many walking and day trips Beautiful old building former orphanage and spacious rooms Big breakfast spread perfect for starting the day off right Friendly and helpful staff I m
Negative:  Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all  |Positive:  The Hotel itself is in a lovely location a 5min if that tram ride into the center Train right outside the Hotel easy access to everywhere The Staff are super friendly and always on hand to help and advice Wonderful bright comfortable and clean rooms Beds are amazing felt as if we were sleeping on clouds Bathroom was clean spacious and airy We had Shampoo Body wash there alongside hair dryer towels safe wardrobe hangers clothes holders desk chair room service hair dryer fridge kettle and cups teas and coffees It literally has everything you need in the room Perfect Hotel couldn t fault it at all The lovely smell from the restaurant downstairs is great Tennis court outside the Hotel little pond as well and a huge park to walk around 
Negative:  Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you  |Positive:  Great hotel original concept style
Negative:  We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom  |Positive:  The hotel itself is beautiful restaurant is very good and the adjacent park is gorgeous with beautiful birds and rabbits 
Negative:  There is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel The hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced The bathroom is not very practical  |Positive:  The hotel is located in a beautiful old monastery building which has a special mood combined with all modern features There is a big park just opposite to the hotel Public transportation and a nice bakery for breakfast are also close Good wifi all around the hotel 
Negative:  Little bit on the pricey side |Positive:  The staff were so friendly and helpful plus the bar restaurant area is beautiful Located in its own park and the old building is simply stunning 
Negative:  Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective  |Positive:  Friendly staff The bar restaurant area is lovely and overlooks the park Very modern 
Negative:  Our bathroom had an urine order Shower was very slippery No shower chair handles or bars Bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off Very expensive and breakfast was not included Construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it There was a park and that was nice Not close to town or museums  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Please see above |Positive:  The hotel is going through renovations and unfortunately it means that the rooms can be less than perfect However the staff did recognise those shortcomings and did everything they could to make the stay as agreeable as possible 
Negative:  The rooms were cold Although nice the room decor was basic and unwelcoming It could use some design help an area rug or two  |Positive:  The room was very big spacious The bath tub was large enough for two people I love the axcess to the from multiple trams and trains The park location was amazing
Negative:  Construction on site but not mentioned on booking com The breakfast can be improved it is quite expensive for its quality  |Positive:  Very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and bed is great 
Negative:  not cleaned well lady pushing to pay during my breakfast poor signs for temporary reception during renovation |Positive:  the building meeting rooms modern style of my room park
Negative:  The glass wall separating the bathroom and the toilet from the room is a weird solution for double It is necessary to darken the glasses much more  |Positive:  Very nice hotel located in a park Ca 30 minutes by walk to the city center Not typical for Amsterdam since most city hotels are located in small buildings But pay attention to the fact that most of the rooms are two storeyed so you will have to use stairs to get to bed 
Negative:  the only thing that would of been better is if i had booked more nights But apart from that there is not really much I dislike about the Hotel I suppose if there is one thing the room I had did not have a view only other rooms but I dont tend to go on holiday to sit in my hotel room staring out the window so not really a great deal I can find that I did not like plus stayed for 2 nights and this place was perfect for that |Positive:  The location was amazing the room was fantastic east access to public transport set on the lovely Oosterpark lots of places to eat and drink near by or nice walk to the main areas of Amsterdam I would definitely like to stay here again I only had breakfast at the restaurant on site and this was only once and fairly standard as A brit and a connoisseur of cooked breakfasts I was a little disappointed in the hot food but generally lots on offer for everyone just no where does a cooked breakfast like the English but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to wander and explore for my dining experiences But not qualified to give a true opinion of the restaurant it was certainly busy in the evenings which suggests its pretty good I will definitely be staying there again if possible the next time i take a trip to Amsterdam
Negative:  Staff a few were friendly and willing enough to help but we ran into one gentleman who seemed to be in training and was totally ineffective Every question we asked had to be referred to someone else he wouldn t make eye contact he wouldn t even just say I don t know the answer let me find out for you There didn t seem to be a manager around Unfortunately there is still a lot of construction going on so it is difficult to see what the building will be like when finished The temporary reception area is in a very small dark area under the central staircase too bad Breakfast was overpriced for a good but ordinary buffet  |Positive:  Location on the park with easy access to tram lines was very good 
Negative:  Several parts of the building outside are under construction at the moment and getting to the reception required a little search around Also the standard rooms are located towards a rather frequented street which gets very noisy when opening the windows This is rather necessary though due to the sleeping area on the first floor of the room being somewhat stuffy  |Positive:  The hotel is nicely localted directly within the park which is accessed when walking out of the building The building itself has great history and wonderful architecture The staff is very helpful and friendly when in need of anything 
Negative:  Hotel undergoing the building of a new wing not that this caused us any issues except signs of building work meant reception was a temporary pop up affair Rooms that we had were tired and in need of some love First room had a broken window mechanism and signs of damp with chunks of plaster missing around the window area Shower did not drain properly and overflowed after only a couple of minutes We requested another room which we duly transferred too which was better although bathroom lights would work for no longer than 5 minutes before they went out guess a problem with a transformer overloading Fault reported but not rectified during our stay The building is magnificent the rooms we had just needed some care and attention and then the hotel would be first rate  |Positive:  Nice restaurant although felt breakfast was rather expensive at 17 50 per head Location as expected but with hind sight a little further from the main tourist areas than we might have liked but was quite nice to be out of the noisy city centre Staff very courteous 
Negative:  Hotel is going through a major construction renovation was not mentioned during the booking process Staff is poorly trained check in did not work breakfast staff was more interested in me signing the breakfast check although I prepaid the breakfast then serving my cappuccino Room was huge 3 4 meter high ceilings and freezing cold Heating worked in the bathroom very hot but not in the room Was not able to take a shower in the morning water was boiling hot could not regulate the temperature Forget working in the room no working area feels more like a sanatorium And for all that I paid 250 Never again  |Positive:  Love the design of the renovated product The park nearby for a walk 
Negative:  Water pressure in my shower was no existent Feel bad even saying that  |Positive:  Staff were amazing very very friendly and proud of the place they work in The cafe is very cool Will be back
Negative:  The service was awful They refused to take ownership of a mistake on their part even after being asked about it in the morning  |Positive:  The brunch to purchase in the morning was good 
Negative:  Bathroom lighting could have been brighter The airconditioning of our room 303 could not be turned down lower than 23 degrees celcius The refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat The toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either  |Positive:  The location of the hotel is super opening out to Oosterpark The staff was very helpful and friendly The bed was very comfortable The room was spacious enough for 2 people 
Negative:  The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else  |Positive:  Massive bed
Negative:  The hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups  |Positive:  The hotel looks really impressive Set in a beautiful location The room was clean well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable I d ever slept in 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The quality of the hotel was brilliant and even though it was under renovation there was no disruption or noise The location of the hotel is far enough away from the centre of the city that it did not feel like a tourist trap and it is also situated in a fantastic park near some great bars and restaurants I cannot fault the staff facilities or the price and would highly recommend this to anyone 
Negative:  Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck Room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here |Positive:  clean and new
Negative:  The bar was shut when I got back at midnight which seemed quite early for a hotel bar on a Saturday night in a city like Amsterdam  |Positive:  My room was upgraded because they are doing renovations in part of the building The room I was given was enormous and very comfortable I wish I had been staying for a week not just one night 
Negative:  When arriving I was told I had to pay 19 city tax That wasn t shown on the policies I pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals The sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor When checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us We waited 30 minutes after 15 we asked how long it would be she said I will check she said that twice Made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight Wasn t happy at all  |Positive:  The location and views 
Negative:  I loved everything  |Positive:  The location in a quiet park with a great terrace The space and the rooms are exquisite with a lot of taste The gigantic beds pillows and bedsheets are super comfortable It s dark and silent which is something impossible to find in Amsterdam Staff was very friendly and accommodating The restaurant with a view over the park is great to work and eat
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Beautiful setting in a lovely park room very spacious clean and comfortable bar area looking over the park was stunning located on the peaceful outskirts of the city but very easy to travel around on the tram system old building with a modern refurbishment it suited us perfectly
Negative:  when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction |Positive:  good and comfortable mattress near tram station helpful people from recepction
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The hotel is lovely and the staff were amazing They even sorted out booking a meal and taxi for me when I emailed them about this when I first booked online This was such a good idea as we found out after that it was one of the best in town It is set in a park and just looks amazing from the outside and inside is top draw too I would highly recommend 
Negative:  there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at 11 30pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until 12 mid night  |Positive:  location in the park Cool interior design comfy bed 
Negative:  Some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task  |Positive:  Location was good but needed tram subway to get to centre of Amsterdam Room was nice but stairs were hard to get up and down to get to bed at night room was clean hotel was nice and modern located in next a lovely park staff were friendly 
Negative:  The hotel is under renovation so even though it was in a park our view was of scaffolding Also the bed would benefit from more pillows blankets Personal preference  |Positive:  The location was perfect and so beautiful Only a tram ride from the centre anywhere really 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Basically everything The style of the hotel is really great The breakfast is really good good quality food really really nice coffe order from the bar The wifi was good in my room and also throuout the hotel The location is near a metro station its easy to get to the center I loved this hotel honestly and i will stay here again for sure The staff cares that you have a good stay i really liked that Thumbs up from me 
Negative:  The place is completely mismanaged The property is amazing and whoever is running the place is doing it a disservice Don t stay here if you are expecting a 4 star experience it s a 4 star location with 1 star service The restaurant service is the worst I have ever experienced The staff need guidance on how to serve efficiently The hotel has many strange design choices too Had a double bedroom with a friend yet you can easily see into the bathroom shower and toilet Shower overflows all over bathroom quickly You can see into the urinals from the reception area Loud security doors right outside our room woke us up regularly Put the security measures on the elevators ya goofs This is the only negative review I have ever written but the place has potential and needs new management  |Positive:  The property is beautiful
Negative:  The bathroom if someone took shower because it will flow over to the elevated floor  |Positive:  Most of the thing we experience is a very good just keep it up
Negative:  Soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear Service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again  |Positive:  I d booked the trip as a surprise for my partners birthday We got a free room upgrade upon arrival and balloons delivery to the room by the front of house staff to wish him a happy birthday Great staff very welcoming friendly and helpful Lovely room very comfy bed 
Negative:  Very bad attitude of personnel at Breakfast Only allowed one coffee from the Coffee machine filter coffee was free Rude behavior of the manager Room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room  |Positive:  Location is good They gave me some freebies for noisy room
Negative:  The bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe  |Positive:  The hotel was fantastic in a lovely setting of a park The hotel itself has been decorated to a very good standard 
Negative:  Not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep Room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us Just bad organisation on room allocation  |Positive:  Great trip staff very friendly
Negative:  Asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each Room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy Wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip  |Positive:  Nice open room Bed plenty of room Bath room clean Fridge was a nice touch Easy to get in and out Staff accommodated us fast and politely
Negative:  Room was not cleaned correctly Wine Champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged From the day we arrived  |Positive:  To begin with we were upgraded which made my wife very happy the room was spacious and warm with minimal noise Breakfast has improved hotel was well looked after It has undergone some major renovations since I last stayed there The new wing looks beautiful and the company has invested a lot into the property Super impressed with the Park and the way nature comes together with the hotel New dining area is magnificent and all food looked fantastic we preferred to eat out for dinner because of sight seeing 
Negative:  The bathroom was amazing Though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times They should think about a screen or opaque glass  |Positive:  Beautiful design comfortable room friendly staff Quick tram to leidseplein and Metro to central 
Negative:  Our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room Didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues I would recommend the hotel to anyone  |Positive:  The bath and shower room was amazing Beautiful hotel They are going through a refebishment at the moment and I am looking forward to when it is complete to see the final look which I think will look even more stunning then the building is already
Negative:  The breakfast was rather average from quality and appearance and not that well organized The young gentlemen managing this were more interested in watching the young female guests This was nice to see but at the same time spoons butter coffee etc were out I would expect a better experience for that price  |Positive:  The building was fantastic All renovated areas were very stylish The receptionist was very friendly and gave us a warm start in this place 
Negative:  Breakfast I missed cutted fresh fruits for Muesli couldn t find the Cheese and for Capuccino you had to pay extra  |Positive:  The young guy at the reception was really friendly and helpful Dinner has been cooked excellent 
Negative:  The sink in the bathroom was very dirty when I got the room Unacceptable The room was freezing cold they could turn on the heating before the guests arrive  |Positive:  The location is really good the room was spacious and comfortable the bathroom as well 
Negative:  upgraded on arrival very good but unfortunately lovely room had a smell of cigarettes mixed with perfume so changed room next room in attic annexe very cold offered a heater but asked to change again back to regular sized room perfectly adequate as on my own and comfortable but bothered by traffic noise from main road outside  |Positive:  breakfast on first day bacon ran out new batch was undercooked and not very hot limited choice of cereal and bread next day much improved more cereal yogurt and cooked tomatoes added 
Negative:  If you are staying with someone who you aren t comfortable sharing every little detail with we wouldn t recommend this hotel The glass box in the corner of the room that doubles as the en suite has practically see through glass even though it s black so you can t be concerned about protecting your modesty Nearly all the guests we came across we re British but there was a complete lack of English Breakfast tea in the restaurant where you had breakfast What made it stranger was we told them it was available in the tea coffee facilities in the room but only with powdered milk but they still couldn t produce any for breakfast The hotel was also undergoing serious renovation works at the time Which didn t really affect us other than when they decided to start taking the ceiling of the restaurant down while they were serving breakfast  |Positive:  Lovely hotel with lots of history Great food in the restaurant and a very comfy bed
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The whole hotel was very clean the staff were very healpful and friendly The dinning area is very modern and relaxing the rest of the hotel has hints of age to it but it works really well The room was exactly how the pictures looked very clean comfy and modern would definitely stay again

Negative:  Rooms were a little louder than we would have liked A lot of noise from people walking by and shutting doors  |Positive:  Funky rooms well designed hotel friendly and helpful staff comfy bed 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Hotel was really nice staff were very friendly and helpful I requested a split level room which they gave me when I arrived The room it self was extremely nice and clean and the bed was very comfy The hotel is not in the centre however is a walkable distance or easily got to by the Metro Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We have stayed here a few times and always enjoyed the fab rooms There are renovations going on that have just made the place extra special Our room 065 was just gorgeous 
Negative:  The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money  |Positive:  The location is beautiful I m sure after the renovations this will be a lovely hotel 
Negative:  I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy  |Positive:  Beautiful room that was ready early with the most comfortable massive bed Backs straight onto the park can t wait to come back when all of the construction is complete We didn t hear anything building work related whilst staying Loved the atmosphere and feeling of all the areas of the hotel Especially the hall to our room 
Negative:  The cleaniness of the rooms can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too Restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel  |Positive:  We like the building although still under construction it has a nice atmosphere Of course location is perfect near the city centre and the parc 
Negative:  Wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed The man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful  |Positive:  The room was lovely great hotel beautiful location 
Negative:  The hotel is currently being renovated Being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above Mini Bar empty No remote for the TV Heating direct above the bed and quite noisy  |Positive:  The restaurant opened 2 days before however the food was good especially the burger Good breakfast with fresh orange juice WIFI in all hotel
Negative:  Initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss |Positive:  Beautiful restaurant with great food and a lovely park to look over quirky and grand in design with relaxing rooms Staff a very helpful and chatty It s a unique place once completed its going to be a fabulous venue we are keen to return in the summer
Negative:  That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel  |Positive:  The bed was really comfortable and loved the style of the hotel room bed upstairs bathroom modern and lots of glass and gloss The food was absolutely gorgeous 
Negative:  Maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No minibar Understaffed reception long wait  |Positive:  Pretty building interesting rooms 
Negative:  No ground floor room as requested 2 months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par Much better last time we stayed Prices gone up  |Positive:  Room changed quickly when we had to complain about the cold and strong smell of new paint Free drink card to make up for renovations inconveniences 
Negative:  We booked 3 twins and were given 2 and a double which they couldn t change Not happy Plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain  |Positive:  rooms were large and modern and hotel was not a normal chain A lot more interesting and quirky
Negative:  Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done  |Positive:  Large bed 
Negative:  The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere  |Positive:  It s a beautiful hotel or should I say will be when the renovation is finished 
Negative:  In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair  |Positive:  Good location Cheap 
Negative:  So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms |Positive:  Anyways the staff was extremely friendly no complants there Location of the hotel is about 1km from the nearest metro station The rooms were tidy and the beds were good to sleep in However there where several small faulty details unfinished renovation in the room like lamp on the floor nails sticking out of floor which rips your sock etc so nothing major but adding them all together it makes this as a three star hotel in my opinnion 
Negative:  There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas  |Positive:  Beautifull buiding next to Oosterpark Friendly staff Great breakfast 
Negative:  The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate  |Positive:  Great room very comfortable bed Nice and quiet Fantastic decor and amazing staircases The location is great if you want to avoid the hectic nature of the city centre and red light district but can be walked in around half an hour The immediate area is fantastic great Park amazing local restaurants frequented by locals etc one of which has the largest selection of beer available Near by brewery that do tours not Heineken and great beer Good museum near by and even a local coffeeshop that we better value than those in the center 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We upgraded to a larger room Had the bath infront of the bed which allowed us to relax before having the best nights sleep I ve probably ever had due to the comfort of the beds 
Negative:  Our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout  |Positive:  A very quirky hotel that managed to keep its identy despite moderisation situated in a lovely location Bed was extrememly comfortable and cleanliness of hotel was outstanding 
Negative:  Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing  |Positive:  beautiful surroundings great location Old world style of the hotel is really different
Negative:  Building work starting at 7am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance Also air conditioning very very loud |Positive:  Location
Negative:  Hotel is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down I thought |Positive:  Location was ok and has access to all the public transport a very pleasant park is situated next good for a jogger or just a stroll 
Negative:  There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant  |Positive:  The bed was amazing Actually our whole room large room The park burger at the restaurant downstairs was also heaven 
Negative:  it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot  |Positive:  super comfy beds cozy rooms lovely staff pretty sweet location I love amsterdam 
Negative:  Building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle  |Positive:  Staff were brilliant Really helpful attentive and friendly Amazing building with lots of history too 
Negative:  Construction during the day though not intrusive |Positive:  Great Customer Service Staff very responsive to our individual needs also helpful in giving directions getting tickets and Metro passes 
Negative:  The front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined  |Positive:  The rooms were comfortable and clean and the bed accommodated sleep well Restaurant and bar staff were very helpful and friendly The breakfast was quite good where there was a variety of selections available to choose from 
Negative:  No Limited A C in common areas Dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters Musty smell throughout common areas Deluxe rooms very small impractical design Impractical shower design no place for soap Poor quality bed mattress Room refrigerator barely worked Food in restaurant overprices only fair quality Overall dark rundown dreary appearance |Positive:  Good water pressure in shower
Negative:  There was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator Perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place  |Positive:  The hotel is located in a very nice area of Amsterdam There are museums parks shops and restaurants around as well as many tram stops that can take you everywhere in the city Staff were very kind 
Negative:  The hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us Overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious  |Positive:  We upgraded our room had a huge room with a large bath tub 
Negative:  there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view |Positive:  Vibe is good location good and historic building is will be beautiful
Negative:  Staff promised things they didn t deliver Room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant  |Positive:  Generally clean and interestingly designed But a little worn Meanwhile there is massive renovation underway which will probably make it a much nicer hotel but in the meantime you will walk up a wooden ramp to reception and many amenities are in process The reason to stay here is that it s cheaper than other similar properties possibly because it s in renovation and also because it is off the beaten path though not in a bad neighborhood just not close to the hot spots 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Architecturally the building is terrific you can feel the history of the place which just isn t there with purpose built chain hotels The Arena has the look and feel of a boutique hotel lushly decorated wrought iron work on staircases chandeliers the up lighting and high windows and ceilings gives a great sense of space Location is fab in the green space of Oosterpark but only a ten min walk to the City Halls The rooms are quirky with a small footprint THe ground level has a closet small sofa WC and shower fridge table and chair with the huge bed on a mezzanine level There s a tv on each level 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Breakfast was very nice and the staff were so helpful especially with giving us advice on transport around the city Also the bed was comfortable so we slept so well each night 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This hotel was great value for money Only a few tram stops away from the city centre It was close enough for all the attractions of Amsterdam but far enough away that it was a quiet neighbourhood The zoo is literally a 10 minute walk away or one tram stop Very accessible The room was extremely nice and the bed was outstandingly comfy best nights sleep I ve ever had I would highly recommend this hotel 
Negative:  We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel  |Positive:  Very friendly staff lovely comfy room
Negative:  I wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only 20  |Positive:  food recommendations were brilliant
Negative:  The outside of the hotel is under construction It will look beautiful when it s done  |Positive:  The inside of the hotel is very classy He staff are friendly and helpful Our room was great Huge bathroom with double sinks and showers small sitting room with a kettle and fridge beautiful bedroom with a big comfortable bed The hotel is a nice area There is a big park next door and it is only a 20 minute walk to the Heineken Experience 
Negative:  the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware  |Positive:  Bed was really comfy and we had a canal view which was nice to wake up to The hotel was warm and beautifully decorated We were given a free drink voucher to compensate for construction which was really nice
Negative:  The hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation The sidewalk entrance was a mess There was no mention of this at all on the booking com website We were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation Not good enough  |Positive:  The location of this hotel is great It s very close to the tram lines and subway The staff was very helpful in getting us a room that was to our liking The breakfast buffet was fine 
Negative:  Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend  |Positive:  Breakfast was plentiful although often cold when meant to be hot bacon sausage etc Next to park which makes for a pleasant evening walk and tram services nearby Staff very friendly willing to help 
Negative:  The first room had steep steps to a loft bed Not practical and dangerous for someone 68 especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night Second night had a room on one level  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all The room size was also pretty small  |Positive:  Well located if you don t mind taking the train 
Negative:  Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed |Positive:  this beautiful building has huge potential but you get the feeling that while the extention work is going on the hotel is less of a priority It is starting to look frayed at the edges But there is a good and funky atmosphere and the breakfast was very good The location was also perfect for us as we were visiting relatives nearby and it is also a quite airy part of amsterdam 
Negative:  The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central |Positive:  Liked the staff The location
Negative:  Overpriced breakfast Bed too soft Bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on Building works impact on overall good impression  |Positive:  Special ambience of old convent and medical institution converted into a modern style hotel Relaxed atmosphere Nice restaurant and bar area with terasse Good accessibility of public transport 
Negative:  We were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in 3 days We had to ask for more towels We ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after 3 mouthfuls my friend was sick  |Positive:  Room was a great size and comfy bed
Negative:  We did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains Told reception but nothing was done about it It definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back  |Positive:  The staff were lovely and very helpful Bar and restaurant very good not far from all attractions very good tram links 
Negative:  The bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to The lighting in the halls was too dim  |Positive:  There was a lot of variety at breakfast and the fresh baked croissants were excellent The snacks in the restaurant were also very good The staff at the front desk was cheerful and helpful The bed was comfy 
Negative:  We had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought We told reception but nothing came of it Very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on  |Positive:  Bed was comfy with duck feather duvet and pillows We stayed in a deluxe split room and it was very nice Reception staff bar staff was friendly and helpful 
Negative:  Two storey room with narrow winding stairs Wet room d cor and functionality Lack of storage space |Positive:  Very helpful and friendly staff Free WiFi Location and proximity to public transport Provision of iron and board 2 televisions
Negative:  There was a staircase in our room between the bed and the bathroom This means the bathroom is very spacious and lovely but can be a bit of a pain in the middle of the night  |Positive:  The hotel has its own character and a long history Very cool vibe We got a round of free drinks as consolation to the construction work outside 
Negative:  It would have been nice if the one responsible for the cleaning of the room had swept up the crumbs from the floor It was noisy from the main street It was not heated floor in the bathroom and as it rained pretty much during our stay it was difficult with wet shoes There was construction site all around the hotel and the choice would have fell on another hotel if we had known this I am sure it will be very nice when it is finished  |Positive:  Good breakfast nice beds nice to live at a hotel with history 
Negative:  First impressions of the dark reception made us wary to begin with Also we were given a duplex suite to start with Dutch stairs are very steep and we asked to change rooms which staff were most accommodating about The hotel is being renovated externally but this didn t affect our stay at all  |Positive:  Comfy beds we upgraded to a suite which was very spacious with a bath staff lovely all speak English restaurant food exceptional and great choice at breakfast Tram stops right outside and next to a lovely park
Negative:  Foyer was a mess Only place to relax was the bar and that was not comfortable enough to stay for more than a drink or two We had a very cold spell and it was draughty The first room whilst ok for a honey moon couple was totally unacceptable for any one over 30 or afraid of hights The second room was huge cold and paint in need of repair The hotel states it is four star but is not It feels like a up graded backpackers It is basic clean no frills or comfort three star max I thought I was booking a comfortable picturesque hotel it felt like and old school building we later found out that is exactly what it it was The hotel was under going major re constructions to the foyer entrance area nothing was mentioned at time of booking It was very disappointing and embarrassing as I had also made the booking for our friends who we were travelling with Very expensive hotel with nothing to make up for the expensive rooms  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  the club sandwiches cold bacon with congealed fat and processed chicken Very poor  |Positive:  The friendly staff in bar restaurant The evening meal was excellent A pity the club sandwiches at lunch were awful After the building renovations I think this hotel will be fabulous It has so much history and is so unusual Loved it 
Negative:  The only complaint we had was the iron in the room was not a steam iron and it was travel size which did not work particularly well  |Positive:  The staff were very friendly and helpful and our room was amazing the bed was really big and so comfy 
Negative:  There was a little construction at the time but we were compensated with a free drink and room well away from the work  |Positive:  Great room great staff great food 
Negative:  Building working next to entrance wooden platform to door looked unwelcoming Gothic look of reception area Checking out at 11 30am Wooden beam at one side of bed bloking your way See through glass to shower  |Positive:  Food in restaurant Quirky place use to be a hospital Reasonably convienent for transport into city centre Beautiful park beside hotel Walk through to other side for some nice cafe basrs for breakfast 
Negative:  We didn t like our first room the stairs in the duplex were very steep and narrow  |Positive:  Beds were comfy the bar staff and reception staff were very helpful when we asked to move rooms
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Beautiful gothic hotel Very good location Some nice bars and restaurants Fabulous Thai restaurant 5 minutes away 3 metro stops from Dam centre Really enjoyed staying there There was building work ongoing but you would never have know 
Negative:  The fact I had to leave |Positive:  The whole experience was amazing there were construction works going on but the staff made sure it didn t impact your time there at all very friendly and very helpful
Negative:  The d cor but hotel is currently being extended I expect the d cor will be updated when this is finished  |Positive:  Room was lovely we got a free upgrade Bathroom fab Excellent breakfast Nice sitting out area for those who wished to smoke Reception and dining bar staff exceptionally nice 
Negative:  The interiors are looking quite tired and the deluxe room on two levels was not to our liking This hotel was listed as four star though we would not consider this an accurate rating  |Positive:  Quiet location and thankfully the construction to the exterior of the hotel did not impact our stay 
Negative:  Currently have building work in the complex This didn t affect our stay as we heard nothing but visually not ideal when you arrive  |Positive:  Very comfortable bed and cool hotel
Negative:  Stairs in our room were too narrow and steep No where did it say hotel was undergoing extensive building work and room looked out onto main busy road  |Positive:  Hotel was very clean and staff helpful Very trendy and reasonably priced
Negative:  We booked a 3 night stay in a suite On arrival the room was tidy but not clean paint falling of the walls in a couple of places During the first night we were woken up by an intruder to the room at 0630 I went to the reception to investigate and explain what had happened It turned out to be the night cleaner who had no business coming in our room He came to apologise with a feeble excuse I tripped and fell into the door We didn t buy it and asked for a full refund credit where credit is due the manager gave it to us I asked her to remove my credit card from the room security deposit to which she assured me it was We went to a far better hotel and thought the matter was done with No it wasn t I came home to find my credit card had been charged 420 from them I phoned them up to complain and the money was returned However I have lost about 30 in bank charges due to their incompetence Terrible experience in what is essentially a hostel  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The noise of the construction works that began at 7am sharp in the mornings The see through toilet bathroom the shabby sinks and sandpaper like tissue paper  |Positive:  The bed was huge and comfortable Massively high ceilings and the feature staircase 
Negative:  The hotel is currently under going renovations and while this wasnt a major problem work did start early on Mon morning  |Positive:  Staff were very friendly helpful The kitchen provided us a great meal the bar staff were nice and the breakfast bar was very impressive 
Negative:  There were construction works at the front of the hotel but this didn t make much impact when inside However in the reception and all the way to the bottom floor lift was a strong eggy smell that I can only put down to the work outside It was abit gross but once we were by the actual rooms any sign of abnormal smell or noise were gone completely Considering it was a 4 star the room could have been abit neater ie The corners of the room were abit dusty the paint on the windows was cracking but there was nothing major  |Positive:  The style of the room was unique and amazing with a light room laminate floors and a stunning black bathroom Our kingsize was very comfy and spacious The hotel itself is very beautiful and they have kept the original staircases and high ceilings All of the staff spoke English perfectly just like most people in the city and I couldn t fault them on anything they were always willing to answer our questions and even gave us a map and told us where we could find some interesting places Hotel Arena s location is pretty perfect as it is less than a 10 minute walk from a tram stop to Centraal Dam Square Rembrandtplein and any other places you might be interested in exploring It s also right next to Oosterpark so I can imagine how nice it would be to go to in the spring and upcoming summer Really loved this place overall and a great hotel to stay at especially if it is your first time in Amsterdam as it was mine 
Negative:  More sofas needed in the bar better breakfast options water pressure in the shower was rubbish really noisy on the road no difference between open or closed Windows soft closing doors are needed room was way too hot and unable to turn the heat down No mention of the building work going on  |Positive:  Location was great for us as was close to my sister there was always someone on the desk the bars were lovely the building was impressive but building work going on which we didn t know about but I m sure it will look amazing Really funky room 
Negative:  When we first checked in they gave us a tiny twin room which is not what we had asked for Once we came back down and asked to be switched rooms we got a far nicer room probably twice the size with a kingsize bed so not sure why we weren t given to us straight away as we are clearly a couple Also for the price it would have been nice to have been provided with breakfast or at least some toiletries other than soap we had forgotten our toothpaste  |Positive:  The bed was super cosy The staff was nice The hotel isn t central but if you get bikes it s very close and easy to cycle 
Negative:  Room 240 should be discontinued It is really too small and only upsets your Customers Breakfast okay but choices a little limited compared to others You could add seeds more fruit etc at very little extra cost  |Positive:  Staff were fantastic and changed our overall view of the hotel Got off to a bad start room 240 was tiny and they changed us No argument Bar staff and reception staff really friendly and pleasant 
Negative:  Could hear music being played by the people in the next door room late at night  |Positive:  Cool hotel great receptionist who gave us ideas of what to do in Amsterdam delicious supper at the hotel And great shower 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Bar and restraint staff were great reception was a bit lacklustre Also th bathroom walls are completely see through Wouldn t advise number 2 s if you are sharing a room 
Negative:  The cleanness was quite poor A lot of dust under the bed under the furniture on top of the bed side lamps the remote control and even the plastic glasses in the bathroom were dirty Also something went wrong with the pipes of the shower a horrible smell came out at night  |Positive:  The staff was very nice and friendly the size of the room was really great and the style of the hotel is also very nice The bed was quite confortable 
Negative:  Being given a ridiculously small room initially and having to go back to reception and ask for a bigger one was rectified politely Building work being undertaken all round the hotel the ticket for one free drink per guest issued as compensation only covered a small drink I d rather not have the ticket for the drink than go through having that explained in the bar later that evening If you are going to compensate do it properly  |Positive:  Average good accommodation Big room Helpful staff Room cleaned daily Big hot shower Comfy bed 
Negative:  The first night we got there we where put in a room where there was a horrible smell coming from the bathroom I raised this with the staff and was given another room However we where there 3 days and the housekeeping is shocking They do not clean rooms properly but most importantly no clean bed sheets They just come make ur bed that s all Same cups same rubbish it s disgusting Please note if you are not a couple or prefer privacy DO NOT book this hotel their rooms are designed in such a way they are not practical Glass doors n the toilet n shower are clearly visible from the room which was really annoying we had a room where I could see the toilet from the bed Other than that it was ok not worth the money we paid  |Positive:  The only good thing about this hotel is the friendly staff and the way it looks Considering they have work going on Location is great 5mins walk to tram stop n your in damn square in 10mins Also we bought 3 day travel ticket from the train station for 25 euros n the hotel sell this for 17 50 euros so buy from hotel it s cheaper Trains are not included in the hotel travel card but u won t need trains if your staying in dam Only to and from airport 
Negative:  I hate when the beds are two separate beds pushed together That may just be a European thing or maybe I got the reservation wrong either way I would still go back to this hotel |Positive:  The place looked amazing and it was close enough to everything that walking was not a hassle
Negative:  the hotel was in a bad condition Not really clean and everything was worn out Breakfast was barely OK and room service dinner was bad low quality and cold when I got it Hotel Arena doesnt deliver what its four stars promise  |Positive:  Bed was nice 
Negative:  Rooms could have been a little cleaner and better maintained  |Positive:  Really nice building but lots of building work going off But only outside so not a problem Good size rooms fairly modern Good location away from the center but easy to get to by tram WiFi worked perfectly and quickly

Negative:  The room we were given originally wasn t very clean there was a problem with the floor which was unsafe they said they didn t have time to get this fixed before my stay which I thought was poor No bath in room even though I requested one on booking |Positive:  24 reception Changed rooms immediately after complaint
Negative:  Radiator in bedroom needed bleeding but really not a problem  |Positive:  The staff were very friendly and helpful Rooms s good size Nice bathrooms Bar area very comfortable Complimentary drink a nice touch A little walk from centre but gave us a chance to look around Plans for development look amazing Would like come back when completed 
Negative:  Location is a little far from centre the hotel is tired it needs a bit of money spending on it polish it up and make feel new again as it doesn t feel new it feels tired  |Positive:  Cool hotel nice feel really comfy beds staff couldn t do enough for you
Negative:  Room could have done with a microwave our room had a small leak in the walls from where the rain would come through  |Positive:  The room was exactly as expected The bed was the most comfortable bed that we have ever slept on the shower was HUGE Easy check in and check out only a 5 minute walk to the grocery store staff were very friendly and public transport is only minutes walk from the hotel room or if you like walking everything you need to see is only a 30 45min walk 
Negative:  The hotel was incorrectly informed about my room type booking Building work within the grounds worth mentioning but is not is noisy or obtrusive  |Positive:  Great hotel and quiet university area Wonderful comfy beds in clean well equipped rooms The food is wonderful 
Negative:  The shower was slightly faulty but we told the staff and they will be giving us some money back The room could ve been slightly cleaner in places and the refurbishments going on meant that the hotel was surrounded by construction works But very good value for money  |Positive:  The bed and size space in room was amazing very comfortable stay Very happy with our room for the money that we paid 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive The room itself was amazing and the bed itself was so comfy we struggled getting up of a morning I would recommend this hotel to anyone

Negative:  The location isn t great bit far out from the centre and area surrounding hotel looks rough The hotel looked out of place there When upgrading to a suite with bathtub extra 25 one of the pillows was filthy A call to reception and a new pillow arrived within the hour But still not what you would expect Room service is very expensive and not good quality or as described on the menu  |Positive:  The rooms were gorgeous bathroom to die for we upgraded to a suite with bath the hotel interior very nice lovely atmosphere Due to building work In progress we were given a voucher for a free drink at the bar nice gesture 
Negative:  Hotel under sonstruction which we weren t aware of when we arrived there was no rooms for us they asked upon arrival if all 4 of us would share a room which wasn t something we were prepared to do we booked 2 separate rooms for a reason we booked 2 double deluxe rooms but ended up being put in 2 twin rooms which over looking the building site over all not worth the 500 pound that was spent  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  the change over of staff at the check in too many different faces over 3 days must of been greeted and welcomed by 8 different members of staff just at the reception desk that the rooms were not depicted on the site as they were when we arrived the room was stunning but would of liked to have seen that when booking |Positive:  The decor the atmosphere the welcoming staff the room was incredible
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The hotel is amazing Beautiful interior We weren t disrupted by the work going on as the place is sound proof Our room was fantastic the only thing I should have done was ask for a fan at reception because the room temperature was too hot and the air con wouldn t go below 21oc The room layout with the bedroom upstairs was lush 
Negative:  The bathroom door was hanging off the light fitting fell off from above the bed there were marks on the wall and ceiling where flys had been squashed against it but not washed off afterwards  |Positive:  Room service good quality staff
Negative:  We didn t have a bad experience  |Positive:  We loved the setup of our room we liked the separation of the bed from the rest of the room the meals were fantastic too very filling 
Negative:  Only complaint would be walls are a little thin and could hear next door but not a major issue |Positive:  Hotel was very modern and location was great Complimentary drinks was a really nice touch 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights with my boyfriend The hotel was perfect A short distance to the square with the tram located near the hotel Perfect loctation lovely park beside the hotel with cafes nearby Staff were very helpful and the hotel in general is fabulous very modern and the bedroom was just great the layout was fantastic with cute steps up to the bed which was super comfy We really enjoyed our stay 
Negative:  Breakfast not included in the price and whilst it was good we feel it was on the expensive side Split level room that we had wasn t in our view very practical although others may like it  |Positive:  Staff were helpful and friendly from start to finish 
Negative:  They charged all our bank cards at the beginning of our stay and the money is then returned if you pay by a different means Unfortunately they charged 2 of us twice and we are still waiting for the money to be returned a week later Just spoilt it for us as we have been chasing our money back |Positive:  absolutely stunning hotel lovely food and selection of drinks and a really good location
Negative:  When I arrived we got given a little card for a free drink for each of us due to it being under construction disappointed in the fact that before I booked it they never mentioned anything about having work done All the lovely garden had been tourn up Then the next morning I got rudely awakened at 6 45 7 00 by work men banging this went on for a good hour or so That s probably why I wouldn t stay at hotel arena again I was disgusted by that and the fact they don t do full English breakfasts  |Positive:  The bedrooms were pleasnt the bed was really comfy It was nice the shower was clean I enjoyed my room Wasn t allowed to check in till 3 but managed to get us a room by 2ish which was good 
Negative:  Finding no car park when I had chosen a hotel with a car park was very annoying There was no real place to drop off our bags so we walked from the hospital car park some way The staff were a bit abrupt not really listening I asked for another pillow in the morning and when none arrived by evening I called reception They said one coming very soon I had to ring again and was told his colleague had been told Some time later I had said I wanted to go to bed the pillow arrived with the explanation he was busy and had forgotten I took the opportunity to ask if we could cool the room down as we were so warm the night before The answer was no but we could have a fan I said no because I did not want to risk waiting  |Positive:  The room was pleasant We liked the big bathroom and the bed was large and extremely comfortable The mini fridge safe tv s with English channels and the ability to make drink were pluses
Negative:  The shower has no curtain whatsoever so the water just spills over the whole bathroom  |Positive:  Nice comfy and cosy rooms with very big windows so there is plenty of light A lot of trams in the vicinity so it is easy to the city centre or any attraction 
Negative:  The location unfortunately were a bit far from the center 20 min by tramp  |Positive:  The room is beautiful and comfortable the shower is one of the best I ve ever seen The staff is very kind I would very much recommend this hotel if you don t mind travel 20 min to the center 
Negative:  The fact that building work meant the nightclub and half hotel were closed Woken by builders two mornings at 7am complained to reception who said it was saturday the next day so shouldnt get woken up no other compensation offered apart from a drink token on arrival in the form of two halves of heineken not good enough in our opinion  |Positive:  The room we upgraded to was very nice 
Negative:  Breakfast was expensive and hotel could have benefited with a Gym Swimming pool |Positive:  Location was close enough to anything we needed hotel was big clean spacious rooms and nice bar with friendly staff at a very good price would happily stay again
Negative:  The hotel is being renovated and an extensive development is unfolding just outside During working hours the noise can be very disturbing The facilities look and sound rickety The A C is extremely loud and not very effective overall the room was too cold What s worse turning it off makes it possible to hear water flowing dropping through pipes in the walls Chinese water torture anyone The bathroom walls are transparent And I don t mean you can maybe make something out if you squint I mean Oh my word I didn t want to see that There is maybe one spot in the room where one does not have a complete view of whatever is happening inside the bathroom The staff didn t change the towels they simply re folded them 3 days in a row with no new towels The hotel is quite far from the center and there s little to do around it If you think you can walk think again and take the tram instead Or another hotel  |Positive:  Polite staff 
Negative:  The bathrooms are more like a cubical with transparent glass Not ideal if you re a fan of your own privacy Considerable renovation works were ongoing during our stay for the inconvenience we were offered a free drink at the bar I thought this was a nice gesture until I was repeatedly told I can have that drink or that one only a tea coffee or 25cl beer You might have well not bothered Hotel Arena It was more like an insult  |Positive:  The staff we encountered were absolutely delightful and very helpful The rooms were clean stylish and comfortable The hotel was conveniently located within walking distance of the centre of Amsterdam 
Negative:  the restaurant food was terrible my first room was facing the garden construction site which starts at 6am in the morning although per local law is not allowed when I reach the staff he said he could do nothing about it while the construction is actually owned by the hotel it s a real bazaar they can t control it after my insisting they changed my room but the fridge safe and sink wasn t working I stayed there 14 days never again  |Positive:  nothing
Negative:  In our own experience First night we couldn t sleep due to an extreme hot problem caused by the AC The next day we were moved to a better room ok but I was expecting to be refund for the night without proper sleep and we didn t AC was very noisy also in the new room And last At reception you will be told that reserving a taxi to the airport will cost 44Euro After doing so the taxi driver eventually charged us 55 Euro The driver simply said not responsible for promises from the hotel reception Be aware of that if you wanna use taxi from Arena |Positive:  Staff was vey pleasant The place is very well designed
Negative:  Arena hotel is located in a historical building and definitely needs to be renovated On the territory of the hotel just at the main entrance there are construction works Standard rooms have stairs beds are on the upper level The space of the lower level is very small 50 of it is bathroom No cafes and supermarkets in the nearby No minibar in room only at reception Arena is hardly a 4 star hotel in reality it can be regarded as a 3 hotel only  |Positive:  Location is good it takes 20 mins by feet and 10 15 mins by tram to get to the city center 
Negative:  Reception staff seemed a bit strange not that helpful  |Positive:  The room was stunning Did not expect the quality standard received after having to walk past a building site and enter through a dodgy back door Will definitely recommend 
Negative:  Cost of taxi to the airport said it would cost 55 euros driver charged us 78 euros But only payed 45 euros from the airport to the hotel |Positive:  Very smart room good food 
Negative:  No plug with washbasin Staff did not think this was a problem though I did Had to change from ground floor room where bed was up a very steep ladder on a mezzanine  |Positive:  Breakfast Staff
Negative:  the building work created a bad first impression of the hotel as had to enter through a back door through building mess would expect to be notified seating in room uncomfortable as had no back rest had to sit on floor with back against settee stairs steep to go to bathroom at night was a little precarious breakfast expensive in comparison to outside restaurants  |Positive:  staff helpful but maybe because of building upheaval hotel history and architecture a real treat would stay again try another room and see the hotel when fully refurbished possibly have a discount due to the visit being in middle of a bulding site and not as expected when booked 
Negative:  The toilet has glass walls no privacy The room was dirty after 3 days because the cleaners never hoovered the room the towels never changed the fridge was empty the room was very small I don t understand how this hotel has 4 stars The day of our check out we were forced to leave the hotel at 8 30 because they would cut the electricity and the hot water due to renovation in the hotel  |Positive:  The hall
Negative:  Partially frosted glass door into bathroom was both a tad noisy and a bit too sharing  |Positive:  Nice staff good rooms with separate little living room and bedroom did not experience any problems with the reconstruction 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Staff were really friendly 24hour front desk beautiful hotel the room I stayed in double deluxe was amazing lots of restaurants nearby for good food And easy trams into central 10 mins I highly recommend 
Negative:  Room particularly bathroom was a bit dirty when we arrived We found a pair of women shoes under the bed a clear sign that the room was not properly cleaned In addition the daily cleaning was very basic Unacceptable for an hotel of this category Such a pity because everything else was great My advice to the management is more attention to details Having read the previous reviews it seems that the hotel managers don t really take comments on board Not conductive to maintain grow the business Listen to your customers please  |Positive:  Very beautiful building cozy room cool bar 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Staff were very friendly on arrival we were upgraded on arrival fantastic room with lovely no fern decor there was works going on outside the hotel but we never heard a thing and it didn t make a difference would definable return to the hotel arena
Negative:  Taxi from hotel to airport was extortionate price so we took the train Breakfast was nice but very expensive  |Positive:  Close to Tram Excellent room nice staff 
Negative:  Renovation around the hotel sometimes can start at 08 30 am and woke you up There is nothing inside the minibar but they charge deposit of 150 euros for nothing in the room They dont have a luggage room instead they have lockers but for this they charge deposit of 10 from you  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The room wasn t cleaned two days in a row I don t think glass wall and door to the bathroom is a good idea Didn t notice any navigation and got lost in hotel corridors for a few times  |Positive:  Good Wi fi 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Good location next to the tram but is under going a major revamp No noise problem but the lovely garden is gone Sill good value for money This is a big place lovely old building 
Negative:  At first glance it looks like a dream hotel But then when you go see the hotel renovated and under construction which was not mentioned to us in advance Importantly they did not hear the construction work but ideally they indicate the presence of this order Even the room itself looked like dreams a room with two floors first floor shower toilet living room and a small refrigerator upstairs bedroom But at night when you go to sleep it becomes a nightmare room The doors of the rooms slammed shut and all entry and exit from different sound intensity in our room There really bad in this hotel because of the noise of slamming doors In addition the room may flooring and also hear every footstep in the room above you and from you Clean room we had not exchanged towels for 3 days until we asked  |Positive:  The best thing at this price excellent price in relation to the modern and spacious room received 
Negative:  Would have been courteous to have been told that building work was going on Bar staff wearing jeans and trainers is not in keeping with 4 hotel Having to ask every day for milk for tea making in room Having to ask for towels that were not left in the room Room 304 no shelf in the shower for putting shampoo razor etc  |Positive:  Character of the hotel was great Location was good
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Hotel and rooms were beautiful My friend and I wanted some luxury on our trip to Amsterdam and this hotel provided just that The staff were extremely friendly and gave us lots of advice on where to go local life etc You will need to get trams metro from this hotel which all added to the experience of our trip Would definitely recommend this hotel 
Negative:  The only negative was the noise there were building works going on at the time which we were aware of when booking our stay and which weren t a huge problem but we did find it difficult to sleep with the noise at night cause by i assume the other guests It was probably enough to put me off visiting in the future  |Positive:  The staff were extremely polite and helpful i honestly couldn t fault them The room itself was clean and comfortable and the location was great 
Negative:  Not given the room type we had booked and prepaid for No on site car park available despite pre booking of this Hotel was a building site so not very welcoming No privacy at all in bathroom as separated from lounge area by glass panel only Stairs to bed level steep and dangerous as no hand rail Arrived for our prepaid breakfast to be told we hadn t paid and had to show our payment receipt to prove we had  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  next to a larger construction site shocking at first sight but not noisy or disturbing at least not during my stay |Positive:  friendly staff place is very clean and charming beautiful restaurant and bar food looked I didn t try it way better than the usual Amsterdam culinary sins
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This was our first time in Amsterdam and the staff were incredibly helpful They took special notice of the fact that is was my birthday and were so friendly 
Negative:  Building work going on at the hotel didn t know this when we booked and didn t get a discount monday morning they started at 6 30am  |Positive:  Great location lovely room
Negative:  The room with stairs was quite uncomfortable with very reduced spaces and steep stairs  |Positive:  Very nice property stylish hotel friendly staff spacious rooms except the one with stairs and close to the city center just a couple of stops by tram 
Negative:  The hotel is going though a period of renovation and extension Construction work starts at seven and is rather noisy Especially the entrance area is affected But the hotel does need a facelift  |Positive:  Boutique atmosphere good size rooms with comfortable beds and stylishly designed bathrooms 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  It was a well kept hotel in a lovely area The staff and services offered were excellent We felt it was a great value Our beautiful room with a view was a bonus 
Negative:  Its hard to get back to the hotel later at night since the tram is off after around midnight and walking 30mins after going out in the other end of the city can be tiring but we managed anyway This is not a big issue unless you really prefer to be in the center rather than in a beautiful quiet hotel as this one Not enough soap in the room restaurant bar snacks are very expensive Also I would ve appreciated being told that there is construction going on before the booking although this was again a non issue except for the small visual inconvenience in the entrance No noise or dirt at all  |Positive:  The hotel is beautiful the pictures here arent doing it justice at all right on Oosterpark which is awesome The location is great walking distance to the tram public transport to anywhere and 5 10 mins to POI convenience shops and small local bars on the quieter part of the city You can also get to the city center by walking but it will take about 20 30mins Very clean room made and towels changed everyday Almost perfect 
Negative:  No convenient stores surrounding hotel area Had to walk quite far for grocery shopping |Positive:  Crews being nice and helpful Environment quiet and peaceful but unfortunately certain areas under construction 
Negative:  The pillow and the double charged city tax One of the staff at the reception is not so nice  |Positive:  The bathroom and sofa are so good The building style is really awesome 
Negative:  We don t like the open concept shower It gets very messy on the whole bathroom floor especially if you re not used to it Not a huge fan of the see through bathroom concept when you can see your friend using the toilet whilst watching television it is cool to watch tv while in the bath though The hotel room was otherwise very nice  |Positive:  We liked the location and the extra pleasant staff They were very accommodating to our requests e g extra towels and specialty pillows 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  I loved the hotel design and decoration Staff were extremely nice always helpful and smiling That is something you really appreciate when you are on a 24 hour business trip Breakfast was way better than I expected although coffee was quite bad That is something most hotels fail to nail and I think most guests find it important Rooms are fantastically cozy clean and comfortable 
Negative:  Iron wasn t very good Bathroom is glass walls so you can see through it Building works took away from quality of hotel We didn t like they reserved 150 on our bank card which was not made clear prior to booking and we are still unsure of why this was done |Positive:  The bed was comfy and large The wifi was fast and good Separate living area Powerful shower
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Got in late and hadn t eaten 24 hour pizza delivery offered at front desk brilliant at 12pm friendly staff and wifi in room hotel is 15 mins walk from dam square nice to be away from the hussle and bussle in town

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The matress and pillows were exceptionally good Best sleep in terms of comfort ever I would be grateful to know your suppliers as would like to replicate this comfort in my own home 
Negative:  The rooms were cleaned daily fresh towels etc but the linen on the bed was not changed and had dirty marks on it  |Positive:  Although the hotel is a little from the main centre the hotel itself was outstanding The hotel is currently under construction and expanding its capacity and restaurant bar space I was shocked when we arrived to see a construction site but you couldn t hear any building work from the room and the hotel was impeccable inside Fantastic value for money but I assume once the construction has been completed the hotel will be one of the top places to stay in Amsterdam The bar and restaurant is an added bonus to the hotel and the staff were pleasant and polite The hotel is spectacular and the rooms are modern and very comfortable the previous reviews regarding the bathroom walls are true but we didn t find that an issue I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially for the location as many trams lead to the centre of Amsterdam in only 7 10 minutes 
Negative:  Our room was gorgeous but no big light it was broken so was in dim lighting my stay really steep stairs in my room 62 was genuinely scared walking down them house keeping made my bed but didn t change the sheets  |Positive:  Great bed bathroom beer garden decor staff and food 
Negative:  n a |Positive:  This is a fantastic place to stay and felt like true luxury despite the amazingly cheap price that we paid for our stay There is work going on at the moment but we were given free drinks which were delicious and would both love to return to see the hotel when all the work is finished as it is such a fantastic place to stay that is steeped with history Also the shower was incredible 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We loved our stay at hotel arena The hotel was great Staff was really kind especially for Job the guy encharged of the restaurant and Sander the guy who recieved us in the front desk Talking to them it came up in the conversation that my boyfriend and I got engaged the day before arriving to the hotel That night when we got to our room there was a great bottle of champagne and a beautiful congratulations card waiting for us un our room It was a very classy detail We were so thankful about it Also beds and pillows were great the breakfast boufett awesome and i woukd also recommend to have at least one dinner at the hotels restaurant Food is great Thank u for everything hotel arenaaa 
Negative:  It s a bit of a walk to the tram station that connects to the city centre  |Positive:  Everything The friendly staff super comfortable bed we did not want to get out of bed in the morning it was so comfortable the artsy decor of the hotel chic bar It was truly pleasant to stay in Hotel Arena

Negative:  The room was a lot smaller than advertised I requested a room on the top floor was originally put on the 2nd floor They changed me to a room on the top floor only to find out at 1am that the room had previous electrical issues that they knew about which hadn t been resolved and caused a loud knocking noise Once reported to the front desk I was asked to move rooms at 1am No assistance was offered Second room was slightly larger than the first but not by much I thought the breakfast was a good quality but pretty overpriced Beds were rather stiff but not entirely uncomfortable I didn t find the staff very friendly They weren t mean they just didn t seem very keen on being pleasant bad day maybe The gym is not worth calling a gym Has some meager cardio equipment no real ventilation no tv  |Positive:  Great location it s easy to find and incredibly close to the Earl s Court Underground station Clean Quiet Breakfast was a good quality and selection Nice pillows Lovely large windows in the rooms with beautiful billowing curtains Newly remodeled marble slate bathroom Mini fridge in room Desk had a mirror so it doubled as a great place to do hair and make up Beautiful garden area I didn t get to spend much time out back but it s worth buying a glass of wine and hanging out with some friends in that area

Negative:  Not once during our four day stay including when we arrived to check in did any staff member speak to us before being spoken to first We were the only guests in the reception area when we checked in Not one single welcome good morning or hello in four days And we were not disgruntled or asking for any special requirements It was a very nice property but that indifferent attitude was a striking difference from every other small hotel and B B in which we stayed on this three week UK vacation We would not recommend K K Hotel George nor would we return ourselves  |Positive:  Small but modern and well furnished room Nice linens and a superior small bathroom 
Negative:  The hotel only support to call their contracted taxi which is expensive and unsafe when we paid by credit card they have no cashier mashine in the car instead they called the back office we had to tell them our credit card no expire month and the security no through the mobile phone this is very riskful for us The hotel should improve their taxi service raise the safety requirement to their contracted taxi company  |Positive:  Very comfortable bed with two kind of pillows one higher and one lower that suit different need in our family The hotel has a inside garden beautiful English style where you feel relax with a glass of beer It s very close to the Earl s court station but still loated on a quite street you can keep the window open while you sleep during the night We like this hotel

Negative:  Room size too small and it was too hot Our window was too small and It good lighting We stayed on the 4th floor and I believ that room should not be used but perhaps converted to a larger room or storage since the lighting was poor from this awkward size window Breakfast was ok but they started taking things away and cleaning while we were still there  |Positive:  The staff was very helpful
Negative:  The room was a little stuffy They didn t have AC on yet Probably too early in the season Shower sometimes went hot and then cold  |Positive:  Hotel was nice and comfortable Very clean Room was a bit small but adequate Staff was friendly and helpful The location was great because it was a 4 minute walk from 2 underground lines Plenty of restaurants convenience stores and ATM nearby

Negative:  We needed gluten free breakfast and ordered it beforehand but the serving was not safe The toasts were but nothing else not The table was set up in the way that cross contamination was difficult to avoid Also bacon eggs and potato cakes were cooked in the same oven and served together Potato cakes had gluten including flours They seemed to have no idea what exactly it all means to serve safe gluten free food  |Positive:  We had gluten free breakfast They had separate toaster for gluten free breads But I can not recommend the breakfast or eating there at all for people who need to follow strict gluten free diet Otherwise I can not complain great full wide ranging and diverse breakfast I just could not eat it Still for sure I could stay there for another time and bring my husband for the breakfast Enough for a big man It was great to have opportunity to print out your boarding passes after on line check in before leaving the hotel

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The breakfast was perfect very clean parking was easy to reach and available even we left the hotel one night to go to Leeds Very kind of the hotel

Negative:  Top floor rooms were so small had to leave one suitcase in the car as unable to fit it in Rooms very hot and had to have windows open in sub zero temperatures Shower over bath tub was dangerously erratic with cold water rapidly displaced by scalding water and no non slip mat or stickers in bath Lethal combination for the elderly or children Second room key not allowed by the hotel s security so had to call reception to let us in if separated Front desk staff very dismissive  |Positive:  Beds very comfortable Pleasant and necessary lounge area off reception with excellent bar staff Area good for restaurants 
Negative:  The breakfast staff were not helpful When we went for breakfast the restaurant was busy and we were asked to wait about 5 minutes to be seated They forgot about us and we had to approach them about our table After 25 minutes we were finally seated I was so upset I did not have a breakfast and left the restaurant in disgust at our treatment We won t be back |Positive:  Staff were courteous and helpful

Negative:  We asked for 2 singles and a sofa bed but were given a double bed and no explanation There were few accessible plugs for hair straighteners and the like and the hair dryer didn t work To be fair we didn t take this up with the hotel so they may have sorted this if asked to do so  |Positive:  Comfy bed a lovely warm room with good facilities on a cold damp London day Great shower nice toiletries and fab fluffy towels Would stay again as it was a great location The things we didn t like weren t the end of the world and we enjoyed our stay

Negative:  Staff could ve been a bit more clued up failed to check my booking room assigned was not what I asked for I requested a double and on entering the room was given a twin So was offered a double in the lower ground it didn t smell very pleasant in the room and the mattresses need to be changed I was advised I had been upgraded This was probably due to the error made on check in however even though the room may have been bigger there were no extras in the room and the TV was much smaller Clearly not an upgrade I don t know I guess for 135 I was expecting a lot more for a 1 night stay On checking in I was asked to pay for breakfast as its more expensive on the day yet it was already part of the rate I didn t have the best start to staying here unfortunately And not even a helping hand with my bag considering the error of assigning me the wrong room laid with the hotel breakfast could ve been more fresh and hotter Appreciate I had arrived 25mins before it closed yet it was still in the valid timeset  |Positive:  location was pretty good with decent restaurants in walking distance Wifi did the job Range of tv channels Shower was lovely

Negative:  Two years in a row we checked in for 10 days On booking we were asked about early arrival and we noted we would arrive before the 3pm check in time No effort was made to shorten or minimize hours of waiting time to get our room Last year our friends from the Midlands arrived for a 1 night stay while we were there and at 9am sharp their room was ready and they got in Let me see ten days and thousands of pound versus one night Who do you take care of  |Positive:  Location location location and breakfast

Negative:  I think this may be a London thing judging from other reviews but the rooms and corridors are tiny think small and take away another foot In our room the window didn t close properly the heat didn t work and the bath did not empty when you took a shower Very dated apart from the TV If like us you intend not to be in your room much the hotel is adequate but would I stay again not if it was free is the answer |Positive:  The Location was good on a quiet street about 200 meters from the Earls court Tube and buses Close to some nice restaurants and pubs for breakfast lunch or dinner

Negative:  Definitely not a 4 star hotel Triple room was super tiny not even a double room size we were really struggling Not enough wardrobe space not enough plugs in the room third bed very umcomfortable Facilities very basic toileteries including only shampoo and shower gel very bad quality not even shower cap or body lotion Except for the reception ladies staff very rude Definitely not reccomended Being in London in the same area several times and there are definitely better real 4 stars  |Positive:  The position of the hotel was very close to Earl s Court Tube Station
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The location was perfect Stones through away from Earls Court station Staff were all lovely and accommodating Gardens were lovely Cracking Thai restaurant round the corner too Rooms were fine nothing outstanding but clean and the bed was comfy We didn t use all the hotel facilities unfortunately as really busy sight seeing 
Negative:  Cleaning of the hotel is a bit slow room does not get cleaned until 5pm For people who like to take some rest in the hotel during the day seems to be inconvenient  |Positive:  Very convenient location to transfer and restaurants and even the rooms are on ground floor it is on a quiet street and we are able to a good night rest 
Negative:  Very small room dated interior The cleaning could improve My room floor had an angle from one side of the wall towards the bed The bed was loosing boards underneath it  |Positive:  The staff was helpful and friendly The lobby bar and breakfast areas are pleasant It is conveniently located close to the center without being in a noisy road Very close proximity to fast food chains supermarket and the metro 
Negative:  Maybe bathroom door could open out vs in as it s a very tight space and this would help  |Positive:  Bed linen is so cozy lovely breakfast super showers and staff are great and friendly 
Negative:  There is no proper air conditioning it s set to heating in October so the room can get too hot to have a comfortable temperature to sleep Air con at this time of the year is opening the windows  |Positive:  Location excellent Staff very helpful 
Negative:  We only stayed 2 nights  |Positive:  The location was perfect close to the Underground restaurants etc yet quiet The food both breakfast and lunch was delicious fresh flavorful The staff throughout from front desk to housekeeping to restaurant were delightful The room was spotless bed was heavenly view from the room was a beautiful garden Perfect conclusion to our 3 week stay in the UK
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This is the second K K hotel I stayed at the other was in Barcelona It s a great boutique hotel The hotels are spotless staff is extremely friendly and this particular hotel has the most gorgeous back yard although it was a little too cold to sit outside You re in a good neighborhood not in the thick of it all which is nice for London Would definitely stay here again 
Negative:  There was nothing that we can think of The room key is very large and there is only one They ask that you turn it in when you go out It s a little eccentric but OK  |Positive:  It was small but comfortable and very quiet The garden was beautiful Breakfast was very good Staff was friendly and helpful It is located only two blocks from the tube 
Negative:  there where waterpipes near the room it sounded like it s in our own toilet everytime someone upstairs flushed very loud and sbsolutely disturbing maybe only in these room 12  |Positive: No Positive

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  K k is a heath hotel that can a person stay on I like it a lot I get a beautiful welcome I think to come next year with my family And thank you for all 
Negative:  Thankfully upgraded to a superior room and even that was small and noisy No scrambled eggs at breakfast first morning second morning they ran out of eggs Should be constantly monitored This is a deceptively large and busy hotel I requested somewhere within close walking distance to Olympia 25 min walk is not that close  |Positive:  Staff Great friendly Acomodating In particular reception staff and bar man Wednesday night You can open a bedroom window
Negative:  The bed mattress was too hard without the mattress topper on which we removed because it made us hot The mattress was orthopaedic firm |Positive:  Staff were very helpful
Negative:  Breakfast is good but has some potential for improvements Long periods without eggs etc Very limited selection of vegetables and salad Would probably expect better breakfast from a 4 star place  |Positive:  Very good location in a quiet street with no bars or noisy passer bys Only a short walk to nearest subway Nice and clean hotel but with relatively small rooms Good service but could benefit from a bit more warmth from he staff Nice breakfast restaurant Will come back again 
Negative:  Don t believe there was anything we didn t like My personal choice for marmalade at breakfast wasn t available but I was able to find something else amongst the spread choices to satisfy my palate so this isn t a complaint  |Positive:  The hotel is incredibly handy to Earl s Court Station We loved using the garden at the rear of the hotel plus its quiet location such a bonus for enjoying a quiet G T at the end of each hectic day in London We ate breakfast daily throughout our stay in the hotel s restaurant and the freshness food quality and choices were excellent Being exhausted one night we ate dinner also in the restaurant where we chose from a limited but ample menu Must mention that we had initial fears of noise from the elevator adjacent to which our room was located There was no need to worry as we never heard a sound from it amazing We ll be using this hotel again as it suited us so well 
Negative:  Personally I think the bathroom needs a door to keep water away from the toilet and it will save the clerk a lot of cleaning work by putting a plastic bag in the rubbish bin  |Positive:  Excellent location You have the access to Earl s Court Underground within 3 minutes walk District and Piccadilly Lines take you to most of the sites you possibly need to go especially Heathrow without any transfer Many stores and restaurants around but the hotel is situated in a quiet quarter 
Negative:  Just walking in the reception could be made a bit more comfortable perhaps seating for more than 1 person a table for brochures Also we found that the area had many good local restaurants which could be printed on a simple map as well as grocery stores hairdresser etc These were in walking distance to the hotel and would be a great help for first time visitors  |Positive:  House keeping quality and service very good Even folded our clothes Breakfast was unbelievable You even had stewed prunes First floor room was clean comfortable and very quiet Loved the morning newspapers and availability of little lounge for afterdinner coffee and drinks Liked the breakfast being made available with room price Obtaining a cab at desk was very quick and their services the cab was quality also Would consider staying here again 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Although the rooms are small they are comfortable and cozy and we found the hotel to be a great spot to rest and relax after running around the city Breakfast was included making the price a little more reasonable than many hotels in this very expensive city 
Negative:  Nothing could have been better honestly and I m very critical and picky  |Positive:  I love everything about this hotel it s in a perfect location round the corner from the tube but in a quiet street The breakfast caters for all tastes and is plentiful and delicious The rooms and beds are comfortable and very clean the staff can t do enough for you The whole feel of the hotel is up to and excelling in some cases the standard of an expensive West End hotel but with a cosy feel to it It s my favourite hotel in London and I ve stayed in quite a few 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This is the second time I stay in this hotel It s clean and bed is calling my comfortable Also the vote is near by earls court underground station and the street is full of restaurants coffee shops and supermarkets
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  close to city center 3mins away from Tube station very clean and comfortable rooms very friendly and professional staff excellent breakfast
Negative:  It took them 3 days to charge our card minutes before the client arrived inconvenient and stressful to deal with i had to repeat the story to 3 different staff poor english from staff we cant book for our employees there again |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The breakfast was expensive and not what every traveler would want early in the morning It would have been nice if coffee was offered in the bar for people that werent dining We would have been happy to pay for it too Instead we had to walk a block every morning to get take out coffee so we could drink it while we all showered for the day We noticed many guests doing the same  |Positive:  This hotel was a great value near the tube station in Earl s Court It was one of the few places in London that offered three twin beds in one room which was perfect for us since we were traveling with our daughter It was very clean and charming with comfortable beds and in a lovely quiet neighborhood proximate to transportation to everything There was a nice little lounge bar in the lobby that we stopped into every night after our touring 
Negative:  Why carp when there is nothing to carp about  |Positive:  Staff are well mannered and provide high standards of service Breakfast buffet is first rate Easy access to rest of London esp Old Brompton Road and Knotting Hill 
Negative:  The official price is a bit high unless you can take advantage of a good offer like I did  |Positive:  Location is very useful for Heathrow as taking the tube is safer than taxi if you don t want to miss your flight The place is very clean room size is fine and staff is very good 
Negative:  The room temp was a little warm and the windows didn t really open It was very hot in London while I was there so it wasn t really under their control |Positive:  Great location easy transportation to everything Walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores Room was very quiet and comfortable
Negative:  The ATM machine malfunctioned and a more timely out of service notice would have eliminated some stress  |Positive:  The breakfast selections were plentiful and and the attention to service was appreciated We especially liked the orderly way seating at breakfast was handled Great taxi service was provided when requested 
Negative:  The bathroom was cramped It was hard for someone adult sized to go to the toilet or use the shower easily The shower spilled water out all over the floor There was nowhere to put your dry clothes the sink area vanity splashed so it was wet and the hook behind the door was tiny and things fell off it Water from the shower would have reached it anyway as there was no door screen to the shower in that direction The breakfast was very disappointing It was lukewarm and the eggs tasted highly of vinegar We had to ask for extra teabags as the tea brought to us was very weak and not brewing well I also felt that the sausages were not entirely cooked The bacon was quite watery The selection of food was on the small side and in all it could have been cooked served better  |Positive:  The beds and decor were nice It was an easy walk from the tube station and there were plenty of food establishments still open around it late at night We chose this hotel because three adults could stay in the one room in three separate beds which is a rare thing to find in accommodation Extra pillows and a toothbrush set were brought promptly on request 
Negative:  Air conditioning didn t cope with the really hot weather but luckily had big windows we could open to cool the room down at night  |Positive:  We had a fantastic stay at the K K George Very easy access to Earls Court tube which goes straight to Heathrow as well as being a great start to explore London easily Quiet street just behind the main shops and a lovely garden to have an evening drink in Room was very comfortable and well serviced Breakfast had lots of choice Really a lovely base for a holiday in London

Negative:  Fire alarm and semi evacuation at 2 am little or no direction by staff Reason for alarm a guest had caused an electrical short was announced by Fire officer for benefit of those near enough to hear No subsequent acknowledgement or customer relations gesture by hotel e g perhaps a small discount on checkout other than being told somewhat curtly that it wasn t the fault of the hotel Some guests noticed from the street that a number of bedrooms had remained occupied throughout the incident  |Positive:  Convenient location for our purpose Clean and comfortable rooms
Negative:  The room it was fairly small It wasn t a problem for us as we spent very little time in the room but it was rather compact and may be a problem for those who need to use the room longer than we did  |Positive:  Staff were very friendly and accommodating and the bed was very comfy 
Negative:  Room was a little on the small side but that is to be expected in central London Shower temp was very dodgy but not a major issue either  |Positive:  Lovely hotel great location for Earls Court Tube extremely comfortable beds which is very important after a day of London sightseeing and very quiet We had a great sleep both nights

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Conveniently placed near tube and bus stations and earl s court high street Very quiet since it s in a back lane Nice view from the fifth floor 
Negative:  Cost of the executive double room same as our usual classic double room clearly dishonest Shower bathroom in executive older and not as helpful as the walk in shower in classic Air con did not work So called mini bar is not a mini bar but a bare fridge We have been here many times but the added cost over 100 a night for fewer facilities amenities has upset us a great deal  |Positive:  Like the location as I chose it myself Breakfast is fine and staff very professional and approachable Bed very comfy
Negative:  Room was really tiny and I don t think was good value for money but I would definitely stay again in upgraded room as this is a fantastic hotel |Positive:  Everything except the space in the room
Negative:  Tea and coffee facilities in the rooms need updating and improving The old fashioned kettle and a hand full of tea bags and instant coffee sachets might have been okay in the early 90 s but not anymore And would it really be too much to ask for a bottle of water or two in a 200 per night room Instead of draining the tap dry in search of something other than tepid water from the bathroom sink  |Positive:  The beds were comfortable and the rooms clean and spacious The staff are polite and helpful 
Negative:  Small room Some staff weren t very knowledgeable about the area and transportation options  |Positive:  Great selection for breakfast buffet Hotel location great Near Earls Court tube station Loved the huge garden where you could sit and eat or have a beverage Hotel has a bar high is convenient
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We had a lovely stay at K K the staff was wonderful and so thoughtful When we arrived at 7 30 am after travelling all evening they offered the use of the Wellness Center to take showers amazing fluffy towels and freshen up before we headed out for a day of sightseeing since we would not be able to check in until 3pm That really saved the day and we had an amazing day in London

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  the staff were very helpful with directions and very welcoming The bar area was welcoming as a lone female on business I didn t feel overwhelmed eating drinking there The location to the tube was excellent
Negative:  Rigid rules Our plane arrives in the morning so I requested early check in in the booking Acknowledgement for the request was sent by booking com but no reply or notice from the hotel We arrived and was greeted by a male tall staff with a stern face and harsh tone I started with good morning I know it s too early but I wonder if you ve got a room for us I booked 2 rooms but was just hoping just to get a room first as my father is disabled and he wetted his pants on the way to airport He replied without even looking at me room is guaranteed at 3pm Leave you baggage over there He then started tossing a baggage tag to me and several more The tags are in pairs 1 to tie on the bag and one for us to keep he untied the first pair and literally tossed the remaining 4 pairs to me as I realised it was self service I did the 5 bags by myself and before I could finish he already rushed me to take my tags I can t believe he could be so rude We brought my father downstairs to the loo and got him changed and went out We were so very exhausted and we couldn t help return to the hotel at around 12nn By then we were offered 1 room I saw the lady pulling the file from a stack and I am not sure if there actually were other rooms available already I let my parents in the room and it was soooo very small even by london s standard My bf and I waited at the lobby when we were being stared by the staff like we offended them We waited till 3pm to get our room and of course our room is not next to my parents even though I requested for it when I made the booking and no reply as well And during the check in I had to fill in exactly the same form again with the same info I have absolutely no idea why when the whole booking was made by me myself I understand that they were only following procedures but all these were just very inhuman and inflexible that exhausted guests in every way  |Positive:  Location is good 2 mins to Earl s Court station Loads of restaurants nearby Tranquil neighbourhood Clean Free printing stable wifi

Negative:  I can t think of a single thing  |Positive:  Refurbished with lovely granite bathroom and very comfortable beds We had the classic twin which like most London hotels was small but adequate We suggest you book the breakfast included rate as it is a superior buffet Location is great as only a block away from the tube with the Picadilly line leading direct to Covent Garden and the theatres 
Negative:  Having stayed here a few times before I thought I would have a pleasant stay as usual I was wrong For a business traveller small things like toiletry and wifi go a long way Those used to be good in this hotel Not when I visited this time I ll look for somewhere else for my next trip  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The toilet was too low to the floor The room was much too hot and the Windows did not open  |Positive:  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was lovely All very clean

Negative:  The toilet is slightly small though it contains everything The floor is wooden so you could hear people walking It will be noisy for people with difficulty of falling asleep But for travellers just coming to London this does not count  |Positive:  Unlike the small hotels around this area this one is large and well organized The location is great which is only 3 munites walk from Earl s Court underground station which means it is in a quiet street but also is so easy to get food around The room is comparatively large considering the size of the hotel rooms in London It only takes about 40 munites going from Heathrow airport to the hotel and is very suitable for people with large suitcases and arrive in London not very early I will definitely prefer this hotel next time

Negative:  nothing |Positive:  The location was great on the picadilly line so very easy to get to central London and Heathrow The staff were very helpful and the hotel was very clean and comfortable really enjoyed the stay 
Negative:  Thin wall can hear everything on the hallway I would definitely avoid rooms right next to or across from the elevators as you really can hear people passing by  |Positive:  Great location good breakfast clean and modern hotel Some mentioned the rooms to be tiny but I thought it was a good size room for London Room got a bit cold but the heater in the room worked really well unlike some of the reviews I read Also the front desk called to check in and see if the room was alright Nice touch of customer service

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Often the reality is different from the website but in the case of Hotel George the photos really did portray reality I could not have been happier with every aspect of the hotel I chose this hotel because the average review was amazing This was spot on It s not a luxury hotel but it is a very stylish comfortable hotel that offered interesting little corners like the bar downstairs loved sitting in there before dinner Just a great welcoming stylish elegant hotel where everything just worked Who could want for more

Negative:  The bathroom was far too small for an executive room The key of my room did not work properly  |Positive:  Very good location nice quiet neighbourhood Friendly staff and good breakfast 
Negative:  breakfast times could start earlier Mon Friday to allow for the travel time to get in to the city centre for work Room upgrades are not promoted at the reception or when booking in by hotel staff Wi Fi speed extremely slow The bar prices need to be more in line with the high street prices to attract more guest 5 00 for a pint of Larger is a little extreme  |Positive:  reception staff were pleasant and helpful with all questions put to them 
Negative:  New management means the small luxuries that made this hotel very special have disappeared it will surely not retain its 9 rating for long |Positive:  Comfortable hotel in convenient location
Negative:  Didn t realise we had to book car parking due to limited spaces available We were lucky to have a space will book in future  |Positive:  Close to underground station but in a quiet location Staff were excellent pleasant and helpful good choice for breakfast the bed was so comfortable we didn t want to get up

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Easy to get to from the tube station Staff friendly Room was clean The location was quiet Hotel was well presented Good bars and restuarants within walking distance 
Negative:  Room was tiny and was literally next to a lift built behind the cupboards You can hear it clearly every time someone uses it Definitely ask for a room away from one There is a very annoying and fairly loud noise that randomly kicks in any time of the day Guess its the air conditioning but frustrating when you already have the lift making noises from your cupboard The pillows are far too soft your head sinks in and its not comfortable  |Positive:  Good quiet location and only few minutes from a tube station Friendly hotel staff Clean room and bathroom with nice big shower 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  A boutique style hotel It had a lovely garden Nice touch with a tablet in the room for wifi use Complimentary fresh fruit plate for us The breakfast was superb Gorgeous serving sparkling dishes and plates Quiet location but within minutes of bustle 
Negative:  a bit petty but important extra socket near the bed for charging the phone computer there was only one for the night light  |Positive:  very nice staff at the front desk 
Negative:  This was my sixth visit in K K hotel George I brought this time my whole family with me and had told everybody there would be sparkling wine at the breakfast There was not sparkling wine anymore wich made us unhappy  |Positive:  Near Earl s Court metrostation really easy to reach Staff was very friendly 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Very good continental breakfast excellent location close to earls court tube station The K and K has a very good value and totally refurbished I really recommend it 
Negative:  The room was small and very warm even with air conditioning It was situated beside the lift even though I requested a quiet room The bathroom was even smaller  |Positive:  The hotel is located only a 2 minute walk from Earls Court tube and situated on a quiet street Staff are welcoming friendly and knowledgeable The hotel and room was spotless Breakfast was buffet style with a good selection of both continental and English 
Negative:  Room a little on the small side though perfect for one person Food in room service could have been a little more interesting Good coffee though  |Positive:  Excellent location helpful staff Comfortable room Heated bathroom floor and lovely towels nice and big 
Negative:  room was adjacent to staircase on 4th fnloor Sounded like staff used them in he early hours pre breakfast  |Positive:  style breakfast bar meals great staff 
Negative:  Small rooms  |Positive:  Perfect Location Great value Very comfortable beds We arrived very early and they allowed us to use the fitness center to shower freshen up which we thought was great Nice lobby Right next to Earls Court Tube stop so plenty of travel links Tube train bus etc plenty of shops and restaurants in the area 
Negative:  English breakfast was not too good and a little cold However they do cater for lots of different nationalities not just the English and there was plenty of choice  |Positive:  Lovely hotel with friendly staff Very comfortable bed and lovely bathroom with good powerful shower and underfloor heating We had a room overlooking the garden which was nice Excellent location Would definitely stay here again 
Negative:  The room little bit small But for couple is enough in London you spend most of the time outside the hotel so it s ok There is no air condition in the room or it was not working It was very warm in the room we opened the window to get some cold air in January  |Positive:  The price per night is very good relatively to other 4 stars hotels in London The location is very good 2 minutes walk from Earl s Court metro station at Piccadilly line one of the longest metro line in London direct from the Heathrow airport And to all the popular locations in London Near the Hotel there is 2 big supermarket 4 5 good restaurants and 3 cafes The hotel very clean modern and new The breakfast very good not too expensive for full English Breakfast 15 per person At any cafe you ll probably pay the same price or more The bathroom in the rooms big enough and clean This is my second time I m staying in the k k hotels in Europe they are very good 
Negative:  Bathroom toilet was very small which is fairly usual for London hotels  |Positive:  Great location really near to Earls Court tube station and restaurants Friendly staff and wonderfully comfortable beds Nice hotel with modern touches Definitely stay again 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Very convenient location for Earl s Court Tube station Warm welcome from reception staff Good breakfast with plenty of choice bacon was crisp and tasty not like far too many restaurants who offer limp boiled bacon 
Negative:  I filled in the request form to reserve a parking place although the site says reservation is not needed On arrival no reserved parking place because I only made a request Lousy no wifi on 5th floor no cleaning of room after complaining they told us the maid had gone home  |Positive:  Location
Negative:  Smallish room water pressure in the shower could have been better |Positive:  Excellent location for the price less than 5 mins walking to Earl s Court underground station which has a direct train to the airport on the Piccadilly line good breakfast
Negative:  Prior to booking this hotel we assumed you had disabled facilities but when we arrived there was no disabled facilities which made our stay very uncomfortable we will not be staying again  |Positive:  The staff were friendly the meal was nice could not use front entrance like everyone else had to use underground car park and go up hill 20 metres and down 20 metres down its a accident waiting to happen 
Negative:  The standard room was really too small so they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room We really appreciated that because we were going to spend 6 days in that hotel But even the bigger room is not that big however we realized that this is the case in nearly all London hotels The room did not have central heating It was December and for people like us who are accustomed to warmer climate the room was really cold When we told about it they supplied an electric radiator for us which heated the room but the bathroom was still very cold As in all London central hotels this hotel is also not value for money If it were say in Munich or Milan it definitely would be half this price  |Positive:  Its central location its proximity to metro station 3 min walk to Earl s Court Underground Station free internet delicious and varied food for breakfast and most importantly the really friendly and helpful staff members were the plus sides
Negative:  Only one luft was in operation during peak season Single room was quite small Double rooms looked larger  |Positive:  Everything a boutique hotel should be Well located on a quiet side street 1 minute walk to Earls Court station Tasteful design throughout with great thought to efficency of design Really impressive My single room was quite small but well laid out I WILL go back Liked it the best of 30 hotels I ve stayed in London 
Negative:  See above tangent  |Positive:  Staff were indifferent and sullen I was given the impression the guests there were an inconvenience I left two personal items behind after checking out and after ringing on 9 seperate occasions speaking to several staff members and emailing supposed head of housekeeping I got nowhere not once did anyone ring me back even after promising everytime they would and I never heard from them about my items Ever They also gave me a 20 year old folding cot bed with a 1 mattress to sleep on for 3 nights I Would have thought 1000 plus for 3 nights would have afforded me a bed Yes I complained and they relented eventually Although the location is fantasticly placed I would never ever recommend this hotel to anyone in fact stay well away 
Negative:  I booked a night with the wrong date canceled and rebooked for the next night The booking was made within 24 hours of the stay and the cancellation was not processed When I arrived they insisted I pay for the canceled booking I should have just walked away but thought I could resolve it They were rude and steadfast in insisting I pay for the canceled night I contacted Booking com to help resolve the situation Booking com were very helpful recognized I had made a mistake booking the wrong night and contacted the hotel to resolve the issue The hotel blankly refused Not very nice people at all I would never stay again  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  We were promised the same room we had We left for six days and when we came back they offered us a room off the lobby by the elevator There was no division between the double bed and the single bed I had to insist they give us another room The manager did not want to go out of her way even though I insisted I finally said I would write a letter She gave us a double and single on a higher floor  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Breakfast not the best of choices and although we were still in good time it was barely warm felt like leftovers |Positive:  Hotel staff very helpful hotel was spotlessly clean well maintained
Negative:  in spite of the environmental friendly policy our towels were exchanged on the 2nd day although we had not dropped them on the floor which is an unnecessary waste of resources |Positive:  very convenient location great breakfast friendly staff lovely atmosphere very comfortable beds
Negative:  It was kind of far from typical tourist attractions although most of them were within the reach of a single tube ride  |Positive:  Staff was really kind and the facilities overall were really clean 
Negative:  1 Didn t feel that the executive room was anything amazing bathrobes and a larger bed but room generally small we were in 307 2 Had to queue for breakfast both mornings could you not provide tea coffee for those who have to wait we waited 15 minutes 3 Too warm  |Positive:  Bar area and Reception good
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We love everything about the Hotel George the location the facilities the staff and as this was our 4th stay in 5 years couldn t stay last year due to illness or it would have been 5 I think that speaks for itself 
Negative:  On my previous visit I had booked a car parking space which was key to my decision to staying at this hotel When I arrived there was a denial that I had made a booking This was resolved eventually but the receptionist to whom I had made the booking came up with some waffle that the hotel had not received the booking until the 16th Dec 2 days after my original stay However my booking had been made with booking com on the 6th Dec so one way or another someone cocked up but I was blamed for the failure in their communication Poor show  |Positive:  On this occasion the room was larger than on my recent stay which made things more comfortable however the bathroom was tiny The d cor was OK perhaps functional is an apt description There was minimal noise from the street which is a blessing in such a highly populated area and the location adjacent to Earls Court station was ideal 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  I went to London to visit my niece who was studying in London This hotel was ideally located in Earl s Court close to her apartment and the tube station Very nice hotel and staff Nice selection of food at breakfast Located in a very quiet neighborhood but just minutes from the shops and stores at Earl s Court 
Negative:  The website is misleading the property looks a little tired and feels claustrophobic The parking charges on the full website were higher than on the mobile website which demonstrates a lack of attention to detail The bathroom was tiny  |Positive:  Room was OK if a little small and this was a King Executive Tea coffee making facilities were missing but most importantly it was pretty quiet and comfortable I requested a room change from a shower to a bath which was accommodated 
Negative:  Room was small bathroom very small Breakfast room too small people had to queue every morning Coffee and tea not up to standard Breakfast buffet was good  |Positive:  Location was great lots of nice pubs and restaurants nearby very close to underground easy to get to from heathrow excellent bed 
Negative:  Base in the shower was a bit slippery and stained  |Positive:  Very quiet area nice to have a room with access to the garden I like the fact that it is a small hotel Plus I like the fact that it was a shower cubicle rather than over the bath shower 
Negative:  Parking required a degree in physics to accomplish as the spaces are tight but better than nothing u guess |Positive:  Excellent location close to station location has parking which is very important
Negative:  Having paid to upgrade was very disappointed as the bowl of fruit in the room was a plate with a few slices on it and we needed to remind them Having paid for an executive room expected executive service as was told no tables for available for breakfast They told us we would have to wait and only needed a table for 2 not 6 They know which rooms are which and could have given us priority having upgraded so we went out for a hot breakfast On the first day the cooked food was cold eggs bacon and beans the reception need to speak to firm they use for taxis to the station We were told 25 minutes to Liverpool Street it took one hour and five minutes and we had prepaid tickets on the train so could not afford to miss it We had to run to catch the train by the skin of our teeth it would have been expensive had we missed it to pay on the day The fare quoted was 26 we were charged 30 and taxi driver said there was no way we could have got there in 25 minutes I have emailed the hotel manager with my comments to give positive feedback but so far no acknowledgement nor reply Very disappointed overall  |Positive:  Location staff and cleanliness 
Negative:  Attic room with windows so high up we couldn t see out Bathroom although clean was dated a bit 1990s and mixer tap didn t work on shower so water was either scalding or tepid I didn t realise this still happened in London  |Positive:  Great breakfast all the usual items just higher quality plus cava and nice touches like Austrian apple strudel 
Negative:  The hotel arranged for a taxi to take us to the station at a fixed price of 25 00 it was a private firm and not a London black cab Although the driver was very pleasant and got us to the station on time the car itself absolutely stank of cigarette smoke Not pleasant  |Positive:  Good staff comfortable bed and pillows although we were a little disappointed at the size of the executive bedroom Excellent choice of food at breakfast The bar area is a relaxing place to sit and have a drink with friends or just to sit quietly by the warm fire 
Negative:  One of the staff at reception in the evening apparently has some issues as he was very rude to my wife The rest of the staff were pleasant and helpful  |Positive:  2 minutes from Earl s Court tube Hotel has everything you would want in London Good breakfast comfortable room free wifi that works 
Negative:  We had no ventilation in bathroom |Positive:  The location is superb close to Central and all shopping areas as well as restaurants Our room was good size very comfy Excellent breakfast with big variety vegetarian and vegan options and bubbly

Negative:  Nothing  |Positive:  The hotel is situated in a quiet neighbourhood and is close to the underground station of Earls Court Very friendly staff Delicious breakfast

Negative:  The first room with a king size bed we got had incredibly loud floorboards and no bath we then switched rooms to a twin suite which was much more satisfactory The view many had complimented was rather underwhelming and this from the fifth floor  |Positive:  The place is nice and the breakfast is very good It was nice that you could open the windows to air out the room though in all honesty the room really needed that option
Negative:  It s a hotel needs little updating Continental breakfast buffet was ok hot entrees sometimes only warm often selections were gone faster than the help could replace printer to computer was inoperable the 4 days we stayed Room wi fi was so so |Positive:  Location near Earls Court underground was great Newspapers and TV stations were good View of gardens was nice lots of choices in the buffet nice to have a mini fridge in the small room 
Negative:  No bad experiences at all |Positive:  There was little or nothing wrong with this excellent hotel Our room was very comfortable and a good size for a London hotel It was clean tidy and well equipped The staff were first class They were polite helpful and did it all with a smile which meant a lot The breakfast menu was comprehensive and of good quality We will certainly pay a return visit 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Beautiful hotel great location friendly helpful staff good breakfast included in the price LOVED the help yourself Nescafe in the lobby while waiting for breakfast Thank you 
Negative:  Very expensive would not have stayed except meeting US family at same hotel I trod on sharp debris initially thought it was glass turned out to be shards of plastic probably from a pen on my room carpet which I stood on as I got into bed Staff brought a hoover up to clean but we found more in the morning Shows room had not been properly cleaned Unable to open window as it was stiff and too high up tried standing on a chair Room was tiny and not good value for money  |Positive:  Location for us was important Main public areas high standard and parking a bonus
Negative:  Parking was an issue and we had to spend time asking around other hotels for a space Breakfast quite comprehensive get in quick or you ll miss out on some items Breakfast tea was not a brand to savour Left it after a sip Some guests had also left items uncovered e g Cheese selection and flies were enjoying these There was a timid fox in the garden Although it was lovely to see with small children in particular it is a risk Mobile coverage seemed to be poor and Wifi alleviated issues to some extent  |Positive:  Great location great amenities transport links Rooms had all key requirements Staff helpful

Negative:  No parking on site We parked about 1 2 mile away but it s expensive Parking from 15 30 Friday until 11 30am Sunday cost 42 00 Although reasonable by London standards it s an added expense for a weekend away Perhaps the hotel could workout a concession with local car parks Restaurant expensive given the quality of food  |Positive:  Standard rooms are very comfortable Good central location

Negative:  Nothing |Positive:  Brilliant location so close to the tube Room was GORGEOUS and spacious lovely and modern The hotel was quiet and so so clean Loved it Really made our stay extra relaxing 
Negative:  The shower flooded the bathroom and hallway as there was no seal on the shower door and the plugs in bath and sink were no draining sue to clogged hair when we booked via booking com it initially said breakfast included however it was no and actually ended up costing an extra 40 pounds for two people breakfast was minimal consisting of one sausage a spoonful of beans and 1 bacon and tomato and small black pudding was not much of a selection of cheese etc just a couple of bits that had been out a while  |Positive:  Nice room nice presentation of hotel reception area 
Negative:  The Wi Fi was rather terrible My husband was able to get it to work on his phone but it did not work on mine And since I did not get an international plan for my phone for this trip I was relying on Wi Fi to communicate while in London Thankfully there were other locations around the city where I could connect to the Wi Fi  |Positive:  The location was excellent and within a decent walking distance from the Underground Tube We also went to a show and the hotel is on the edge of the theater district There were also many restaurants and shops nearby and while it was in a busy area the inside of the hotel itself was very quiet The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice The staff was also very helpful we arrived during some kind of system outage but they got us checked in and then let us know the next day that we could come back and check in properly They also got us taxis rather quickly when we needed them 
Negative:  The only thing I d fault was that the pillows were very thick and no options for thinner or different pillows  |Positive:  We were offered an upgrade for a small supplement to a junior suite As part of that you get access to the Club Lounge The room was lovely Looked as new comfy bed very clean And the Club lounge is such a nice extra as it gives you somehwere to sit they have board games finger food breakfast foods and drinks alcoholic non alcoholic available 24hrs

Negative:  Breakfast buffet continental was ok but nothing out of the ordinary A la carte was also possible but we didn t try  |Positive:  Although it s a fairly big hotel the overall vibe we got was very cozy which we liked a lot Staff was very friendly and helpful whenever we needed Upon arrival we received a reduction coupon for the breakfast The location is exquisite 
Negative:  More seating in the bar area would be good also it s a trek to use the toilets  |Positive:  Very clean large rooms with high value toiletries Extremely comfortable bed and pillows Friendly staff 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This is without question one of London finest Hotels I have never slept that well in a very very longtime and I love the duck Amazing reception and great facilities 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Great location room was outstanding beds were so clean and comfortable bathroom had a big deep bath and a fantastic shower we would recommend this hotel to everybody 
Negative:  The cleaner knocked on our door at 8am which wasn t ideal We were checking out that day so no need to clean the room Being fussy the dressing gown and towels weren t hugely soft  |Positive:  The hotel gave us a complimentary upgrade to a suite which was fantastic The room and bed were extremely comfortable Excellent personalised service Food was excellent 
Negative:  This was my second time at this hotel the first time I booked the basic room and was pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room I was given This time I opted to upgrade to a more expensive room and was surprised that it was much smaller than the room I had stayed in before It just might be that I was given a free upgrade the first time  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Going as a family with two rooms hired in the same reservation they allocated us in two different buildings They were even unable to allocate us in different floors of the same building |Positive:  The design facilities and location of the hotel WIFI and also Gym were quite convenient

Negative:  The air conditioning rattled all night and was rather noisy the room was a lot smaller than previous trips but just as expensive A lot better value for money in other hotels  |Positive:  The room was clean and comfortable bathroom was modern and spacious 
Negative:  Nothing your doing a fantastic job |Positive:  Just returned from a wonderful weekend at the apex temple court Where to start From the amazing upgrade for my husbands 30th birthday to the personalised handwritten note and chocolates left for us in the room everything was perfect from the start The hotel is in a great location less than 10 minutes walk to Covent Garden and for location alone is great value I had chosen the hotel as we were attending the aldwych theatre and it was literally around the corner It s clean modern and our room was to die for with a balcony offering views of the London eye The apex offers so many extra touches with the free jelly beans Pringles and of course the apex duck We had a great nespresso machine in our room and robes and slippers all added to make the perfect stay They really have thought about everything We have stayed in many hotels in London but would definately choose apex again 
Negative:  The rooms were too dark and warm After shaving I got on a plane and realized I missed half my face The bathroom mirror was placed right on top of the toilet bowl which was absolutely disgusting Another design flaw was that you had to move the toilet seat up and down in order to flush the toilet The bedroom windows were painted shut which made it awfully stuffy hot and unbearable in the room It was difficult for bad smells to escape since there was no ventilation in the room The walkway outside the hotel room stank of chemicals and the hallway looked soulless like student dormitories One should not be paying so much money for such a low standard hotel which did not even include breakfast The staff were from anywhere else but Britain which did not help make our British experience any better  |Positive:  It was located in a cosy corner off the street 
Negative:  If we had to pick one thing it would be the pillows are a bit to soft but everyone is different Literally could not find fault with anything  |Positive:  The staff were very accommodating it was mine and my partners anniversary and they did such an amazing job at making the room look lovely
Negative:  Location was fine for where I needed to be but if you could find find yourself a little aways from the center and Covent Garden Depends what you looking for underground is about 10 mins walk in either direction  |Positive:  Very nice hotel quiet setting within an inner courtyard Terrace will be lovely in summer plus also very quiet I imagine Very pleasant staff and good hotel bar I didn t use the restaurant neither for breakfast or evening so can t comment 
Negative:  At the outside front entrance to the hotel there is a large carpeted area that was extremely wet due to the weather which spoiled the lovely entrance to an otherwise great hotel  |Positive:  Beds were very comfy bathroom was fantastic and location was excellent 
Negative:  We felt the price of breakfast is just too much and would have added another 100 to price of our stay  |Positive:  The location of the hotel is superb convenient and close to the centre yet tucked away in a quiet hidden away pocket 
Negative:  The room looked straight onto an office window so was a little obtrusive But understand I wasn t paying for a view  |Positive:  The staff were fantastic in the bar super friendly The shower and bath were fantastic 
Negative:  Bath tub was good but if once water falles out there s no pipe to get lid of them  |Positive:  Staff was very nice and interior decoration was stylish and warm Good location to walk around London 
Negative:  Not quite the top notch quality it was a couple of years ago Although still a very good hotel the age is slowly starting to show Carpet coming loose in the hallway wall sockets not EU compatible small things like the bottle opener in the room broken and the nice little Bose speaker have the old iPhone 4 connector  |Positive:  Nice bathroom with big shower and bath Quiet if you get a room on the top floors 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  I spend the weekend in the Apex Hotel with my boyfriend and we had an an wonderful weekend the stuff from Apex was so friendly and they made everything possible have a great birthday weekend in london For this THANK YOU SO MUCH We will come back Best regards Theresa
Negative:  Breakfast is good but quite expensive particularly if you compare it to prices of breakfast to go on Fleet Street  |Positive:  Rooms are quiet Beds are huge Bathroom is spacious and shower is hot and powerful Location is very good Thames within walking distance Temple area is beautiful Note however that during weekends the atmosphere is different than during week days due to the fact that many shops most of the business centres and the criminal courts are closed which results in less people in the neighbourhoud 
Negative:  Service Also they would have given reductions or breakfast in the price but could not because we booked through you Had my 60th birthday while staying The hotel knew this and made no acknowledgement of this not even an extra packet of biscuits Spent two thousand pounds on 3 rooms Felt short changed  |Positive:  Comfortable room which was very clean
Negative:  My son and his family were staying the same two nights in identical rooms He booked directly with Apex and got full breakfasts included for the same room price that I paid Booking via booking com cost me almost an extra 50 for breakfasts even after I had negotiated a bit of a discount by reference to the comparison  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Everything was genuinely perfect  |Positive:  Everything from the reception greeting of Luca to leaving wth yet another warm vibe from reception The cleaning staff were polite and warm My standard room was spotless in terms of cleanliness an incredibly cosy bed a nice ambience to the room 
Negative:  Nothing Our second stay at this hotel and the hotel is very much in our Green Band as experienced and discerning hotel visitors |Positive:  Very comfortable and clean room Balcony was a little plus 
Negative:  Bose sound system was not blue tooth and still on iPhone 4 adapter Advertised sky movies but was pin protected but I m sure we could have contacted reception to gain the code  |Positive:  Alex Hotel couldn t find our booking at first but it worked out that they had upgraded us to a Junior suite which was amazing Free rubber duck was a nice touch and did make us laugh 
Negative:  It took a little longer than expected for for the room service to be cleared from outside our room But that is being ultra fussy as it wasnt left inside the room  |Positive:  Hotel was clean smart looking and great location as well as very professional The room was spacious and the bathroom with both separate shower and bath was a brilliant bonus Our room was located right outside the lifts and we didnt hear anything Also had to love the Apex duck Would definately recommend staying in an Apex hotel 
Negative:  its just really really cheap furnished no seating possibility except ONE office chair in the room nothing comfortable it is MINIMalistic furnished which would be ok in a way but you just don t feel home there Glad I just booked it for one night to try a new place since I am frequently traveling to London and was searching for a place closer to our office in Fleetstreet |Positive:  location would have been great
Negative:  The breakfast system is very over complicated and needs to be looked at It would save your staff a lot of time not having to try to explain how it works Our party of six chose things from the menu as advised but no one told us that if you didn t have the Continental breakfast you would be charged for coffee or tea even though the other breakfast was more expensive anyway It caused a bad atmosphere over breakfast which could have been avoided Make the menu easier and you will be saved the hassle of complaints from customers The food at breakfast was good and it s a shame to spoil the good ratings just for this  |Positive:  Room was a nice size and very quiet Quite a long walk from reception along winding corridors but worth the walk when you got there We were in room 149 which was the very end room on a corridor and we never heard a thing 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The hotel is in a quiet location right in the heart of London so it is within easy walking distance of most of the places we wished to visit We didn t experience the usual problem of banging doors and loud voices that seems to be the norm these days in big hotels maybe because we were right at the end of a corridor maybe because the walls and floors are well soundproofed so we managed to have a good undisturbed night s sleep There was very little traffic noise either It was lovely to be able to go to the local theatres and walk back to the hotel afterwards The Novello is a about 10 minutes walk away I loved the idea of the little duck it made it feel more personal and now sits in my bathroom at home The room we had was a good size the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean A bath robe and slippers were provided as well as the usual toiletries 
Negative:  Service at the bar we had to wait quite long to get served even tough there were only a few other guests at the bar Variety of the buffet was a little poor for a continental breakfast  |Positive:  Location of the hotel
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Really lovely and luxurious hotel Special thanks to Gosia on Reception who went above and beyond to make our stay as enjoyable and special as possible so thank you Gosia 
Negative:  A couple of times the staff missed to replace the shampoo bottles but we are all humans  |Positive:  The room was really completely sound proof We appreciated the bathroom with both tube and big shower cabin together with the super cozy bath ropes And if you like to listen to music properly don t forget to bring a little audio cable jack to jack The superior rooms are equipped with a Bose sound system but it doesn t have a bluethooth connection and you will need this cable 
Negative:  Room on small side for a King very expensive for the Wednesday Thursday nights First night pillows like rocks requested change and got one soft and one slab Third night managed to find 2 soft pillows Bed comfortable Not enough hangers in cupboards for 2 people staying more than 1 night Room temperature control did not go lower than 19C and seemed to revert to 25C once room key taken out Bar prices on the high side  |Positive:  Excellent location good standard of hotel Professional service

Negative:  A bit mean with tea coffee milk in room  |Positive:  Great hotel in good location fairly near theatres St Paul s Tate Modern The City River Thames The Shard half hour walk to Trafalgar Square a bit more to Soho Oxford St Nice to walk along the river to Westminster or get a boat 10 15min taxi from St Pancras Fairly quiet district for London but not much happening in the immediate location 
Negative:  Tray charge too expensive putting us off ordering food smart tv did not seem to work well but none of these issues detracted from a comfortable and enjoyable stay  |Positive:  Given special permission to use hotel parking alongside blue badge holding parents many thanks for this convenience 
Negative:  We got a room 542 with a very disappointing view we were looking right into the balconies of other rooms the room itself did not have a balcony Especially in summer you won t have much privacy Location Temple is very central but still I would chose another central location the next time I m in London as in the weekends Temple seems a bit deserted  |Positive:  Room was very spacious and clean with all the facilities that you need Bed was very comfortable as well The surroundings is very quiet as the hotel has a innercourt and is not directly situated on a busy road
Negative:  1 The hair dryer can not be used in the bathroom and that I can understand But then the plug in the room should be closer to the Mirror or at least to have a larger hair dryer electric cord Because I could not see myself in the Mirror whilst I was drying my hair So basically the hotel has have 3 options Larger hair dryer electric cord Electric plug closer to the mirror Mirror on both sides of the TV 2 Another small comment the shower mat had dessapeared the second night I guess by mistake it was removed and not replaced  |Positive:  The bed really confortable Location is good walking distance to tube and train

Negative:  The Smart TV wasn t connected to the Internet So I couldn t connect my phone to tablet to it which kind of defeats the point of having a smart TV Also the view from the room was pretty much just the wall which ran alongside the building but on the ground floor you shouldn t really expect much else  |Positive:  The bed was extremely comfortably And the bath was really deep you could almost swim in it

Negative:  Maybe a bit more choice for the breakfast but you already have eggs as you want them  |Positive:  Excellent bedding mattress and pillows Room large and very quiet in the upper floors as requested Staff extremely service minded and helpful Wonderful location we took the tube from St Pancras Int l to Temple when arriving However we discovered afterwards that the double decker bus 23 stops a few meters from the hotel and goes to the Strand Trafalgar Piccadilly Oxford Circus etc i e ideal for shopping theatres and activities It was also very easy to go back to St Pancras walking north on Fetter Lane to Holborn then taking bus 45 to King s Cross next to St Pancras Int l 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We were given a complimentary upgrade to the top floor by a very friendly lady who checked us in All the staff we encountered were courteous welcoming I would definitely stay here again Also a perfect location

Negative:  In the area around the hotel there was nowhere open for breakfast at all When we asked why its because it is mainly a commuter working area so we ended up not being able to get any breakfast not the Apex hotels fault may I add Advice would be if you have plans near the hotel definitely book breakfast at the Apex The concierge was also a little rude and unhelpful Not a big issue nor is that the hotels fault  |Positive:  The hotel was a 5 minute walk from Blackfriars station Beautiful hotel with an impressive entrance On arrival the staff were pleasant and friendly and we got a complimentary room upgrade Rooms were fantastic with everything you need Ideal for our romantic weekend away Bar staff were excellent and very accomodating to our needs They had a facility to leave our case so we could enjoy our day in London without our case having to come with us Also a 10 minute walk from Covent Garden which was ideal if you don t like the tube like my boyfriend doesn t

Negative:  We chose this expensive hotel because the photos on Booking com seemed to show a rooftop restaurant with views over London and were really looking forward to sitting there in the evening for a meal When we arrived we were told there was no such roof restaurant although they admitted they had previously had other guests who had expected the same The restaurant was indoors on the ground floor and adjoining courtyard on the ground floor The photos we had seen were of the terrace of one of the penthouse suites showing tables chairs and food We were really disappointed and felt the advertising had been misleading  |Positive:  We were mother and daughter away for a few days in London The room was comfortable and very quiet ideal for chilling out after a hard day exploring

Negative:  They stolen 800 from my money from the safe box at my room I couldn t report to police because shortage of time to reach my flight back They can watch the cameras and identify easily the staff who entered my room and return back my money  |Positive:  Nothing special
Negative:  The room was appalling I had originally requested a room with a balcony as a special request and I understand that may not always be possible In saying that they gave me a room in the basement Supposedly it was a bonus gift from them as it was a bigger room to what I had originally booked Which made me think how small could my room have been if this so called bigger room was this small There was a window with three magnificent view of the buildings pipe work There was a constant noise out the window from a machine of some sort There was not much room to hang clothes or put things away There was a tiny built in wardrobe which could barely fit a handful of tops but the room was for 2 I will not be staying here again  |Positive:  The front desk and entrance was very nice and the staff were helpful 
Negative:  The change of hotel story it repeated with every gusts so I have reviewed some of gust comments before and I faced the same If you booked a room for three adult which is queen bed and sofa beds you will stay in the basement which I will not recommend So the only room fit 3 adult is in the basement otherwise they move you up in room with extra bed for non adult The room pic dose not match the reality  |Positive:  they transfer me to The Park Grand London Kensington due to maintance work at The Park Grand London Paddington they offer me a free ride to Kensington a soft drink while im i watting the taxi and includ the breakfast in my stay which that im not applied for it Park Grand London Kensington newer and bigger than Park Grand London Paddington Underground station 3 mins walk People at reception and generally everyone I interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference the handy phone that comes with the room The bathroom is clean with all required supplies There is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This is my second time staying at this Hotel The first time I was on business This time it was for mini holiday The bed is very comfortable The room and bathroom very clean and spacious The location is very convenient Very good selection at breakfast 
Negative:  Our room seemed hidden away in the bowels of the hotel It did have a large frosted window but when examined it clearly looked out on to a manky neglected ourdoor light shaft  |Positive:  Very handy location to Paddington Station and Heathrow Express and in the pretty Paddington area This hotel is clean and comfortable if a little dated The staff are wonderful thank you And the English breakfast was excellent Not a fancy and extensive breakfast buffet but a tasty and well cooked meal Equally food on the room service menu was tasty and fresh Good Indian and European cuisine 
Negative:  Noisy air con  |Positive:  The room was small but we knew that before arrival I just didn t think that paying an extra 40 for a room that I wasn t going to spend much time in warranted it The wardrobe didn t mark sense as it was so thin you couldn t actually hang anything in it The hairdryer was in the wardrobe and the mirror on the back of the door that didn t open wide enough to look in to blow dry your hair Parking was a nightmare as you have to park 10 minutes away and trudge back with your luggage This wasn t mentioned before booking I wish the hotel would have had a link to booking which is under Waitrose and was 40 for two night The price wasn t that bad it was just the nightmare of walking back and forth with luggage The location was good close to Paddington and Lancaster Gate we walked to oxford street as it was so close and the weather was fab 
Negative:  Our first room had water leaking from the ceiling room above dripping down into our room We had to change rooms and the staff refused to give a monetary refund discount for the inconvenience I asked to speak with the manager about my disatisfaction and for 7 days was put off Additionally the ac was very loud did not work well and I was always hot The junior suite was too small for 3 people The sheets were not changed for 7 days Choose a different hotel  |Positive:  The free breakfast every morning that came with the stay The staff in the restaurant were wonderful 
Negative:  Our rooms were in underground floor it s nothing specifically bad but was not mentioned during booking Unstable wi fi signal in the room but still working The worst part is tiny bathroom It combines toilet and shower on a very small patch and if you are not alone after one person takes a shower everything around like floor toilet is absolutely wet  |Positive:  Hyde Park and public transport are in close proximity we used Bayswater station everyday Staff is really helpful supported us in printing boarding passes The pub across the street is great The room is small but probably good for value because of price and location 
Negative:  Very small rooms Bed was uncomfortable Shower flooded the bathroom No bath Carpet and mattress were stained Expensive compared to other hotels we could have booked in the area that would have offered the same standard  |Positive:  The drinks at the bar were very reasonably priced
Negative:  The photos of the compact room do it show how small it really is This room will only just have enough room for you luggage  |Positive:  Great transport system nearby especially from the airport LHR Customer service is excellent
Negative:  It s very close to another hotel with almost the same name so we went to the wrong one first not really their fault Checking in was very chaotic it was very busy Some people had been double booked Also when we went to check in at 2 15pm one of the rooms wasn t ready as they had a late check out which I didn t think was a very good excuse The hotel was OK but it was expensive for what you got it s the location you re paying for  |Positive:  Location shower
Negative:  Run down needs new furniture and painting Not clean enough and when cleaner comes with just polish and a rag then you know it s not being cleaned good enough  |Positive:  Good Aircon Comfy bed Brilliant shower
Negative:  More tea bags and milk for making your own drinks would be good  |Positive:  Good shower and toiletries Air conditioning Big window and pleasant outlook Towels and sheets clean and good quality Apples available at reception Iron available from reception desk 
Negative:  Rooms were not very well maintained Not clean at all To be honest we were expecting better in the money we spent I will never stay in this hotel again  |Positive:  Good location Staff was good 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  location not too bad access to tube and rail confusing with another hotel in group within close proximity went to book into wrong hotel interior bit tired and then we were in the room at the top of the building so bit dark Bathroom facilities strange with wet room set up but not ideal with curtain and door so close 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The space is good for a family of 4 The bathroom is clean with all required supplies There is a microwave and small separate room for cloths and iron 
Negative:  The A C control in the room did not work We notified the issue the day we checked in but it was never fixed We needed to call the counter for them to change the room temperature The furnishings in the lobby need attention they look old and beat  |Positive:  The hotel location is excellent It is super close to the Paddington train and tube stations It is near to places to eat food stores and pharmacy You walk three streets south and you are next to the Hyde Park Kensington Gardens gate I had breakfast at their restaurant two days in a row and the food was good and a good selection of items My room did not have an iron and ironing board in it but it was made available by the staff right away 
Negative:  Room was extremely small with very strange walk in wardrobe space I feel the layout of the room and the dark wood did not help Not good if you are claustrophobic Also as we were in an internal room we were unable to open the windows Bathroom tiny but adequate with a fantastic shower Anyone of a larger build would struggle to move around in there I would suggest a taxi from the station or underground if you have any luggage as its approx a 7 10 minute walk and there are a few junctions to negotiate  |Positive:  Very friendly helpful staff Room was cleaned well Beautiful building in a quiet area of Paddington with good facilities nearby
Negative:  We couldn t see out of our window there wasn t much of a view  |Positive:  The room was very modern and clean Staff were also very friendly and made our stay extra special 
Negative:  Wifi is slow as it seems to be in most London hotels breakfast is buffet no a la carte available |Positive:  Convenient location very clean and modern good coffee helpful staff

Negative:  The room was a bit small but still very good for London standards I was at first disappointed that there was no proper shower it was the floor of the toilet bathroom which you don t expect from such a hotel but in the end it was ok and the water had good pressure  |Positive:  A nice hotel in a very convenient location Very clean People at reception and generally everyone I interacted with was super friendly and helpful which makes a difference I also appreciated the welcome plate of fruits as well as the handy phone that comes with the room Very convenient especially when your own phone is behaving weird in other countries All this made up for the price which I initally thought a bit too much and I still booked an offer that was supposed to be largely discounted 120 a night for a compact room If I paid the full amount I would think it is overpriced but I guess that s London in the summer 
Negative:  The design of the toilet bath area will get the whole floor to be wet Would be better if there is a segregation The tap of the basin seems to be old and it was very tight  |Positive:  The club room is comfortable for 2 Clean and bright The room seems to be newly furbished The toilet is spacious too 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  OMG What a tiny tiny room You could not walk around the bed without walking sideways No room for anything No barfridge Appalling really when they tout themselves as being boutique

Negative:  Bathroom needed a bit of renovation |Positive:  Paddington is a beautiful suburb and unbelievably quiet for London Rooms are a reasonable size for London and the window could actually be opened which makes a nice change Complimentary fruit water was also a nice touch Definitely would return to this hotel
Negative:  The bed was very uncomfortable and too small The room was smaller than expected and it was a luxury room  |Positive:  The location of the hotel was brilliant the area felt safe and there were shops and cafes with friendly staff Hyde Parks a stones throw away was perfect and a short power walk to Oxford Street instead of public transport The hotel was accessible friendly staff and had good amenities

Negative:  I stayed for 5 days in the hotel First of all the room was very small and not like in the picture very small Then the A C controller was not working in the room so each time I had to call the reception to change the temperature of the room And the door of my room was in the front of the lift and because it is very old lift there was noise from the lift They told me they will change the room but they didn t  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Room very small and air con didn t work but biggest problem was the position of the toilet as the wet room shower glass door was way too close to front of toilet so had to sit sideways and even then easy to hit your head when sitting standing |Positive:  Modern room good location helpful staff 
Negative:  Our room was very small and in a basement That I did not expect The was no space to unpack things from suitcase Not much daylight no view  |Positive:  I am very fond of Bayswater location Breakfast was ok and serving and cleaning tables was quick

Negative:  No fridge and only plug sockets were far away other than that the room was faultless  |Positive:  Everything had a nice feel to it The staff were friendly and were always smiling and laughing 
Negative:  Booked a Club room when we arrived the room was under the Main Street and didn t even have any windows Hardly 4 Star and what you expect from a Club Room then we asked to be moved in the second room we didn t receive the complimentary Dressing Gowns 2 Bottles of Wine or fruit platter that you were suppose to get with a Club Room Also when going to shower ready for the theatre at 1600 there was no hot water which meant us having to have a freezing cold shower The Club Room Bar they advertise is actually the only bar and the same as everyone else you just go through a different door to get to it with the label Club Lounge on it and we got charged for everything we had in there so don t see the point in having it or the difference in what you get for paying for a better room Tottlag a waste of good money spent  |Positive:  The Porter staff were very friendly the receptionists didn t seem to care 
Negative:  The hotel is fine and well run but the rooms are small But that is the luck of the draw  |Positive:  The Hotel is in walking distance from Paddington Station and so to Heathrow That s my reason for using this hotel

Negative:  Having to share a double bed instead of twin as advertised |Positive:  When we arrived at the hotel we were told that there were problems with the boiler so we would have to stay in another hotel of the chain London Grand Paddington Court We were offered a complimentary breakfast for noth days The following review is of the hotel where we ended up staying which was the London Grand Paddington Court Instead of the twin beds our room had a double Everything else was as advertised good shower tea and coffee ironing facilites We did enjoy our stay but having to share a bed was an inconvience The breakfast was delicious 
Negative:  Our room was far too small and with hindsight we should have asked to be moved One had to negotiate around the bed with hardly any wardrobe space and certainly nowhere one would want to sit comfortably  |Positive:  Really good location Very friendly staff and very helpful We were meeting our son whose birthday it had been recently and we wanted to surprise him with a cake and candles We asked if we could do this in the hotel bar and they not only agreed but also whisked the cake away lit the candles and brought it out to surprise him once we were seated in the bar Excellent

Negative:  Shabby room facilities Poor wifi Poor TV options terrible interface and charging for movies Poor shower no screen no hands free attachment to wall bits falling off not very nice shampoo shower gel Long hallways with sloping floors Not very clever use of space awkward placement of wardrobe and desk May have been fine 10 years ago but not when compared to modern hotels who offer much more comfort for less or equal price  |Positive:  Convenient location and friendly staff

Negative:  Don t be deceived by the pictures of the bedrooms Booked a Double Delux Room but when we got to the room it now seems we actually had a Compact Double Room though reception confirmed we had a Delux after we complained about the room size however now re looking at photos of a Compact Double Room that is what we had Very small double single bed with no real cupboard space enough for 2 shirts on either side of the bed some drawer space no room to put anything even your suitcase Bathroom was a wet room Did not pay for expensive breakfast and instead had breakfast on the way out in a cheaper cafe which are close by  |Positive:  It was clean and staff were friendly and very central Nice to have complimentary fruit and water in the room no wine as someone else mentioned

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Our room was clean cosy and quiet excellent powerful shower and added bonus of under floor heating The breakfast buffet was amazing very polite and helpful staff We will definitely be returning on our next visit

Negative:  On arrival at Paddington Hotel we were told that there was no hot water and that we were being transferred to another sister hotel The Hotel was the same and was a nice hotel however as we had chosen the hotel due to its close location for all our planned activities being transferred to earls court south kensington was very inconvienient and distrupted our plans to the point that we were unable to make several visits that we had planned as we were unable to walk to the locations we had booked and had to spend extra monies and time using the tube taxis We received a voice mail from the hotel in the morning advising us of this fact but as we had already left for London we did not receive it  |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  The mirror arrangements in the room were awkward to use for my wife The room One of the hidden wardrobes could have had shelves in it for extra storage The lack of double glazing meant we had to use the supplementary heater each evening Only one comfy chair made TV watching awkward and difficult We did not take breakfast as we considered the room rate should have been inclusive of b fast  |Positive:  We liked the space in the room and the bed was comfortable The welcome pack and instructions could be more prominent and make clear whether the wine and water was complimentary or not As we weren t sure we avoided using it 
Negative:  The room 138 is small and I do not like having to shower in the toilet area Would much prefer a separate shower cubical this would stop me using this facility if I was given this room again as second time and not happy with the en suite facility Air con was adequate other guest complained of it on the day as well  |Positive:  Price and location

Negative:  They take a temporary deposit from ur credit card to make sure you don t cancel and even after paying cash on checking the keep ur money from your card for a further 8 days after staying which is uncalled for also wanted 20 despite on checking for cover off mini bar of which I refused to pay to find out on arrival off our room the mini bar was empty so why need a deposit  |Positive:  The style of hotel

Negative:  I booked a deluxe double room there was nothing deluxe about it The room was tiny Literally the smallest box room I have ever stayed in The bathroom towels were dirty and we had to request new ones be provided The shower curtain did nothing to prevent the water covering the entire bathroom floor Which meant there was nowhere to then stand at the sink without getting wet There were no plugs near mirrors which made getting ready difficult I resorted to using the TV to see my reflection as I blow dryed my hair The room quickly got condensation due to it being so small however no windows could be opened Altogether an awful experience and I will not be staying there again The pictures were completely disieving and the cost was ridiculous based on what we actually got Very very disappointing  |Positive:  10instead walk to Paddington station therefore good access to all tubest etc

Negative:  I made the booking on behalf of my 18 year old son I am concerned that having booked in advance and paid in full for the room on my visa debit card at check in my son was asked to re pay on his card and that I was to be refunded This practice is unacceptable as it is only by chance that my son has a card and also as a student there was enough money in his account to pay for the room Having to make this unexpected payment caused limitations and cash flow issues for my son I had purposefully booked and paid in advance to avoid any complications In my mind there was to be nothing for my son to do except check in and enjoy his room prior to handing to Heathrow airport the following morning Please advise why this occurred and why this process is employed The reimbursement of my original payment is exceedingly slow It should be instant as monies being held for a period of time from both my son and myself is inadmissible Helen Jackson |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  Rooms were uncomfortable not properly cleaned very little space for clothing no shower curtain in bathroom so the entire floor got wet  |Positive:  Convenient location to Paddington Station

Negative:  I had a bad experience with this hotel During check in the woman in front desk told me that they have problem in water heating system and they cannot accommodate me in this hotel due to this reason and they booked other hotel for me I felt uncomfortable by this offer since the second hotel was far away around 2 miles and the hotel was full of guests and no one of them was talking about heating system So I decided to to turn the table against them so I request from woman in front desk to show me the room For testing the water heating system by my self Suddenly her supervisor came I forget to take her name and it became clear that they have overbooking in this hotel It clearly proven they try to handel this problem by laying to the guests During that an European guest came for check in and the process for check in goes smothly I start shotting to the hotel staff by saying this hotel treat guests beased on nationality What a shame So the decided to give my room which was non refundable but they give me a very bad room with bad location Later they change the room I will never book again in this hotel  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  I booked for 6 nights instead of 5 I contacted them within 5 minutes of the booking but as it was a special deal they refused to amend the booking even though I contacted them straight way The built in panelling in the room was a bit dated and made it very narrow and difficult to get around the end of the bed  |Positive:  The english breakfast was great The staff were very friendly and accommodating and the hotel was in a great location in terms of value for money 
Negative:  A shower curtain There was none which is the style but it sprayed water everywhere on the floor |Positive:  Bed was comfy Room had a big closet for luggage The reception area was beautiful And a 5 min walk to the trains and the Heathrow express 
Negative:  The hotel reserves the fee of your first night from your account but doesn t use that money when you pay for the room so you have an additional amount of money out of your account which isn t helpful when you want to use it for spending money You then have to wait for your bank to refund the money to use again so make sure your account has enough in it  |Positive:  The room was a good size and the location was central but quiet The staff were very friendly and welcoming and let us borrow an umbrella when the rain was really bad

Negative:  I confused this with the Park Grand Paddington which is a few doors down the street Their premium rooms are nevertheless rather small and kidney shaped OK for a 1 night stop over but hard to settle in to for longer  |Positive:  Affordable stay in a good location near Paddington and the Central line Easy to get in and out of the city 
Negative:  Room was far too small window was so cold and drafty that we were all awake most of the night I ve never complained about a hotel before but it was awful The only place the cot would fit was in the window and the baby was genuinely freezing cold We had another young child so couldn t move rooms in the middle of the night Consequently we all had no sleep It really wasn t acceptable The room was too small really drafty and the curtains didn t actually meet so the youngest child was up at the crack of dawn too Really marred our holiday Hotel offered 50 back on the room but this really wasn t enough based on such a terrible night Such a shame because this place could be really great  |Positive:  Spotless hotel modern features great extras in the room dressing gowns wine bath products fresh fruit and a lovely breakfast 
Negative:  See above |Positive:  Bed was wonderful breakfast eggs were a watery disaster the shower in the deluxe double was a drain in the floor shared with the loo the bathroom tile grout needed serious scrubbing gross and when I needed change for a smaller money denomination was told that was not possible by a blonde trainee But very quiet room with great view and close to Paddington and Harrods also the rest of the in house staff went the extra mile

Negative:  Fire door near our room banged during the night slightly annoying and could wake you up  |Positive:  Breakfast was lovely good choice and quality Great service friendly and polite 
Negative:  The amount of sugar and milk that is left for you to make coffee tea Unfortunately left a necklace in the room before we left for another location Was never located  |Positive:  The beds were really comfortable and clean The size of rooms for London were what could be expected Advantage close to Edgeware Rd and central to rail and busses

Negative:  the bed was too firm and the pillows too hard Also the lighting in the bedroom wasn t too good and there was nowhere to plug in chargers near to the bed  |Positive:  Price and location very good value 
Negative:  What s with the breakfast confusion Can t British hoteliers just run a restaurant if they want to charge for breakfasts It was one price if booked the day before A higher price that morning Oops you re not on the list blah blah blah North American hotels have no problems dealing with this Put it on your room or pay on the spot No dual pricing So easy Please break the UK mode and make it easy  |Positive:  Reasonably close to Paddington Station so you can take the Heathrow Express Train and walk Good continental breakfast once you got past the convoluted sign up process and pricing

Negative:  deluxe double room significantly smaller than advertised Just a bed with a small ring of floor space around it closet and desk folded off the wall hotel also offers a compact double room that is not that different would only book deluxe double if you are a solo traveller Bathroom so small that there was a tiny drain in the center of it without separate shower so the bathroom got completely soaked with every shower  |Positive:  Room clean modern and made decent use of small space
Negative:  It wasn t mentioned that the room was a basement room and it was very different from the photographs on booking com The room was extremely dusty and we ended up constantly sneezing whilst in the room After we changed rooms we found the hairdryer not working It took a long time to deal with this in the evening The showers were weak in both rooms One day the keycard for our room stopped working and we had to get it changed Overall too many problems  |Positive:  Good location 
Negative:  The automated room was a bit hard to understand for non frequent travellers Staff should try to explain system or ask if the guest is familiar Was moved from one hotel to a sister hotel and offered free breakfast in recompense But no one told the sister hotel and no one told me how I could go about getting it  |Positive:  The bathroom was very nice and rain shower was great to have Staff was friendly and courteous but more knowledge about places to eat or see around the hotel would be nice 
Negative:  Deluxe double was tiny My partner is 6ft and hanging off the bed We were next to an elevator so loud noises all night Shower was dirty had mould all over it and no pressure TV was on a weird angle so you couldn t see it properly If u have big suit cases very crowded and pillows and bed were uncomfortable But saying that we spent hardly anytime in the room so location was great for us  |Positive:  Good location for us Quiet street very Nice area Right near Kensington gardens which means u can walk straight through to Hyde park and get to Harrods ect Also walking distance to 2 tubes which was handy And they give u a mobile so u can use to find ur way around London which was very handy it was quite slow and frustrating at times but still a really nice touch that I haven t had before

Negative:  The room was very noisy we could hear a fan of some sort outside the bedroom which came on periodically and was very loud Every time someone in a room next door above or close to us flushed the loo or had a shower we could hear the water running through the bathrooms open drain The room was very small only one arm chair so when we had room service in the evening one of us had to sit on the bed to eat There is only enough wardrobe space for about 5 things to hang in When I asked why I hadn t got any complementary water I was told it was because I booked through you I made a fuss and did get it in the end but I felt like a cheap skate even though it cost me over 350 for the two nights  |Positive:  The food was excellent
Negative:  Room was tiny and dark I got moved around to a different property one block away because Park Grand had hot water issues Then when I checked into the second location they moved me across the street to a hard location Too much money for such a small room  |Positive:  Staff were helpful and patient Room was quiet and clean 
Negative:  The main mattress for the bed is too soft Feel painful for the back after sleep overnight The mattress for the sofa bed is too weak I still can feel the springs They can be good if you can choose the medium firm mattresses  |Positive:  The location is excellent Close to so many underground stations such as Paddington Lancaster Gate central red line Bayswater dark blue line Queensway red line Also close to the Kensington Garden 
Negative:  Due to it s location its decor the the lounge bar area was not very comfortable to sit relax in It was the walkpath to go to all the rooms  |Positive:  The staff were extremely professional friendly helpful The mobile phone hotel property that was given to guests during their stay was very useful Small touches like having a basket of apples a box of tissues at reception gave a welcoming feel Also the extra amenities that were provided in the room upon arrival were appreciated

Negative:  The double room was so small there was no room to store bags Two people were unable to dress at the same time The walk in wet room was so small that when you turned on the shower it would completely soak the whole bathroom so no one else was able to use Friends staying in a suit were meant to of received complimentary soft drinks fruit and dressing gowns which were not provided The gym smelt as if it was being used as a smoking room Very disappointed in what appeared to be a lovely hotel with reasonable star rating  |Positive:  The only plus was the location being fairly central 
Negative:  The shower water is hard I couldn t get the soapy feeling off even after washing for a while Also on arrival at the airport I called the the telephone given to me at booking which took so long to answer I also found the direction address given to me unhelpful In fact a lady on the line directed me to apparently another branch of the hotel that the one I booked for was under renovation I turned up at the place I booked and found no renovation going on and busy and I got the room I booked for Perhaps it was a mixup  |Positive:  The breakfast was good The bed is firm just as I liked The environment is quite and just a short distance from good restaurants and the underground and train station 
Negative:  The bathroom was not only small but the shower and toilet seem to be in the same position On showering there was water flooding the whole bathroom area The bathroom tiles were poorly put together with the grating sealant coming off quite easily It was just awful I will not book this hotel ever again in this Paddington area of London  |Positive:  The bed and carpet were most comfortable 
Negative:  Everything else you don t expect big and lavish rooms while staying in Central London however a room which has just 18 inches of space around the bed Washroom was also a disaster 140 plus per night is deserves more  |Positive:  Location is good walking distance from Paddington station
Negative:  One of us mobility impaired wish it were a little closer to Underground station |Positive:  Close to restaurants and shopping for travel needs A bit of a walk from Paddington so took a short taxi ride with the bags Quiet nice breakfast and very friendly staff

Negative:  We arrived in the early hours to check in after paying a taxi to take us to front door we were asked to walk to their sister hotel down the street where they then tried to check us in again and charge us again Then headed down to our room where the key card didn t work so headed back to reception they then came down with us and it still didn t work so told us to wait at the room They then returned and manually opened our door and said it couldn t be fixed until the next day It then soon dawned on us that we wouldn t be able to go for breakfast as we wouldn t be able to get back in our room The bed clearly hadn t been changed as there were other peoples hairs in the sheets and pillows my bedside table also had what I can only describe as orange zest all over it This was at 02 30 am so we decided to grin and bare as we were shattered Then the morning came our wake up call of a fire alarm at 09 00 wasn t exactly pleasant followed by the cleaners ringing the door bell several times and getting us out of bed even though we had until 12 00 to check out We left and couldn t get out fast enough after a very bad experience we found ourselves on a street we hadn t planned to be on with no idea which way to head hopefully we wont stumble across this hotel again It really was a shame as it looked as if the place was actually run by someone who cares it could have been lovely But at the tune of 173 00 for less than 10 hours we wont ever be going back  |Positive:  The room did look that when built was a high standard 
Negative:  The hotel operators are cheats liars and thieves I booked a Double and even after calling them on the night of my check in to say that I was checking in late there was NO room for me when I showed up at midnight There was also a family with a toddler asleep on the couch in their lobby who had experienced the same thing They moved me down the street into a SINGLE and then were totally unreasonable about offering me a discounted rate refund on the lousy room BOOO Don t just walk run away from these crooks  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Room a bit small  |Positive:  Our room was much more stylish than most hotels in the Paddington area We were moved from a hotel down the street because of problems with the hot water but the alternative was great The staff at the hotel was amazing and we really felt welcome and we would definitely recommend a stay here

Negative:  On arrival we were given a basement room where there was no mobile phone reception and wifi also poor because it was underground and attitude of reception staff was v rood and not helpfull at all despite I was with family no adjoining rooms were not allocated even after the request reception staff flatly refused and they always refers to talk to booking com However we were given 2 rooms on second day due to pressure Most dissapointing part was the attitude of staff male and female both were rood Sujith |Positive:  Location breakfast

Negative:  I booked a deluxe twin room As per the photos it looked good enough When we got into the room which was hardly 3m x 3m I thought I made a mistake because it had a king size bed with two single mattresses on it with 10 cm gap between them instead of two single beds we went to the reception to check they said this is the only available room and we can t give you your money back The room was so tiny we hardly had any space for our baggage Staff all look unhappy the breakfast experience is even worse Good staff but greedy greedy management and owners Really bad experience  |Positive:  Cleanliness of the room and the fresh croissants 
Negative:  Silly question nothing  |Positive:  I have never stayed in this hotel before It was easy to get yourself lost in Westminster Borough and so had rang the hotel reception for directions and had the whole time to hold the phone on me till I have eventually have found the destination It made my life so much easier as I ve never been around in this part of London before When I walked in to the main entrance I was nicely greeted by the doorman and had immediately carried my luggage all the way to my room My club room was BEAUTIFUL but the only disadvantage was it didn t had a big window as expected as shown on the gallery It didn t fuss me much though The cleanliness of the room was at such high standards and was very impressed with the size of the shower head as it was ENORMOUS I had no problem with the room and had provided me with a plateful of fresh fruit wrapped in clingfilm and two bottles of Merlot Never to late to drink on your arrival why not The best part of the hotel was the breakfast I didn t like the breakfast I absolutely LOVED it as it was the BEST breakfast EVER Everything was cooked to perfection nicely smoked the juices were freshly pressed and a big thank you to the chef for all of his cooking efforts The restaurant staff had welcomed me with a very cheery attitude and had made me felt at home They were so lovely and I felt very accomplished To half of those negative reviewers coming up with such sad enthusiastic comments think again because from my point of view this hotel deserves more than a four star Well done to all and be prepared for my next visit Xx
Negative:  They must have had experience with folk not paying due to the way they went on about payment by card being automatically taken for one night Indeed payment seemed to be the focus and take priority when checking in Not a real negative but after a hard day working in London after a long commute and turning up for a really nice relaxing experience left one feeling a little oh ok that s how it is then Room was small and in the basement and you could see people walking right by on the pavement above while standing by the window when talking on the phone which I had to do since the signal was poor However it could make for an amusing gentleman s past time for someone else of course when the summer really kicks in and skirts get shorter They seem to pack rooms into that building and neighbours are easily overheard Room was rather soulless and didn t have any character or charm at all There was a small long thin vase with 2 real Carnations in which was a nice touch but it fell over and spilt the water on the floor due to the naff round metal glass table it was on being very un level as soon as I tried to move it out of the way of the pop out desk I mopped the water with a towel btw The Air Con was making a racket so I turned it off but a fan was still whirring and randomly screaming all night regardless Despite consuming several pints at the Mitre down the road in a solely medicinal attempt at ensuring slumber of any reasonable length I only got 3hrs sleep But I don t sleep very well in hotels anyway and use earplugs I was alone but the wife snores at home so is a habit so wasn t sure if the fan thing was enough of an issue to try and switch rooms During checkout I wasn t asked about my stay so didn t bother to mention it Room 114 guys beware  |Positive:  Shower is good Breakfast is good Wi Fi is good and free Window had good sound proofing

Negative:  However I did not like how I went into the first room and the ceiling was all opened and I went to reception and instead of doing a room move straight away they doubted my word had to check first and then they moved me plus they knew it was a special occasion so they could be more careful with how they do things |Positive:  I liked the second room I got moved to and the food was very nice 
Negative:  The location wasn t the best for where we were going but nice to be away from the centre |Positive:  The staff were so friendly we ended up being upgraded for free The hotel was lovely and clean 
Negative:  Slight mix up and had to go tongue sister hotel then the sent me back to the original as there was a problem with the original room Room was stated as delux but was quite small |Positive:  The price was great Got comp breakfast for our stay 3 days Great taste Friendly staff
Negative:  Check in wasn t available when we arrived at 10am However it wasn t really a big issue as we could leave our cases until we came back  |Positive:  The location was great close to Train and Tube stations and lots of buses and shops so you are never far from anything or getting anywhere Hotel staff was very welcoming 
Negative:  I ll start off with the location was good for what we needed But It was freezing cold in the room all night I had to call to ask for extra blankets at 4am felt like I was camping outside Had to call twice and wait 25minutes to get an extra blanket The room was an ok size but didn t expect our seperate beds to be together There was one plug outlet for the room as well which was frustrating The throw blanket on the bed was torn and stained as well so that wasn t very nice Noise coming from upstairs and next door We only needed it for the night so I guess it did what I needed to do but I probably wouldn t stay there again  |Positive:  The location was great for what me and my friend needed 
Negative:  No phone signal in my room A bit small room even it s compact double room |Positive:  Confortable double bed Nice staff Amazing ADSL the best I tried in a Hotel
Negative:  1 In this day age the fridge should be a standard however it was not as apparently only available in Club Rooms 2 No slippers or bathrobes either though they did provide the former on request after a little coercion 3 Lat time I had booked a Club Room but it didn t have a proper shower area hence I chose the Deluxe Double this time by checking the bathroom pics beforehand However strangely this had some other items missing like the fridge bathrobes I just don t get it how does it all balance out  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The room smelled of old cigars and the air conditioner blew cold and toxic air you over charged me for breakfast I was one person and was charged for two people |Positive:  I contacted your office by email to discuss a refund for one night because the facility had a filthy room
Negative:  Furniture in club room very tired worn Shower curtain fabric don t like this sorry and shower room very small Tiles of wet room floor cracked too Booked a double room enquired to see if I could change to twin but could only offer same bed base with 2 single mattresses so declined that When checking in was given twin room even though had asked for double to remain Central reservations not easy to deal with on this  |Positive:  Staff lovely fruit and water in room nice touch decent location quiet area 
Negative:  This is not a 4 star hotel in my opinion decor is worn out in places toilets in the main enterance for example where wood was exposed on the skirting breakfast although very nice was too pricy 14 99 Room small they call it boutique but really it is just small The room we had had an enterance hall which was good for storing buggy ect but given that it was a room for a family with a baby access was on the first floor via a lift then we had to go down a flight of stairs to get to the door to our room No bt sport in room or bar so unable to watch a big champions leaugue match surely a 4 star hotel can afford to provide this for guests  |Positive:  Great breakfast friendly and helpful staff comfy firm bed Fab location for transport links and access to londons parks shopping 
Negative:  Air conditioning left room cool even when set to 25 degrees Thin walls could hear man next door snooring |Positive:  Lovely staff fair size room packed in essentials
Negative:  we were on the very top floor when we got into the hotel room it was uncomfortable hot we had to phone down late at night and ask them to turn it down as we couldn t sleep had both windows wide open and the air con on The matress was uncomfortable it was rock solid we didn t get a full night sleep as we were too hot and very uncomfortable The second night in we were up watching TV and the electrics blew we had to phone down and get them to come and sort it which was very irritating afterwards the light over the shower did not work So overall not a good stay we would look elsewhere next time which is such a shame because it was such a lovely hotel and the staff were great  |Positive:  Staff were very friendly and welcoming shower was also lovely 
Negative:  Be aware that the sister hotel is just along the same road displaying a large Park Grand sign outside The staff are used to directing new guests to the correct hotel  |Positive:  Nice atmosphere friendly staff and our club room was very clean and comfortable 10 mins walk from Paddington station 20 mins to Hyde Park 
Negative:  There was a humming sound in the room in the nights and it was really small They start vid some reparing on out floor early in the mornings strong smell from spraypaint The toiletdoor is right by the bed Rood staff in the reception both checking in and out  |Positive:  The Breakfast staff was highly service minded 
Negative:  I didn t like the noise came when you switched the heating on at a certain temperature I didn t like not having much off a view from window looking on to other rooms |Positive:  The bed was really comfortable the showers were good the staff were very pleasant
Negative:  Air condition was noisy Pillows were lumpy I changed the room twice but as You were full I had to have the first room anyway The second room was cold and the shower room floor icy  |Positive:  The Staff were great The tiny Bar lounge was comfy wasYour Details Full Name Email Address Confirm email Address Password Confirm Password Marketing Information From time to time we may send out marketing information which we feel is of use to our users Please check this box if you wish to receive this additional service This will not affect your Jobs By Email subscriptions Please tick box to confirm the following I have read and agree to the terms and conditions and privacy statement This is a condition of registration 
Negative:  Stayed in room 309 Club Room damp carpet by shower room noisy plumbing and a strange smell  |Positive:  Friendly staff Good location and facilities great rooom size Reasonable value for money just think I got a tired room 
Negative:  The cupboard where the hairdryer was didn t open all the way around making the mirror on the inside impossible to use unless you leant across the table Not a big problem just poor design  |Positive:  Great location 5 minutes from London Paddington Very helpful staff and room was upgraded to a spacious club room which was a nice tough Shower was powerful and beds really comfortable 
Negative:  TV could have been a little bigger |Positive:  Location was excellent short distance to the station and well connected the internet was great and so was the staff 
Negative:  Breakfast hall was located in basement restaurant so bit akward to find initially |Positive:  Everyone was very polite and the food was excellent I will definitely stay there again
Negative:  room was cold the heating was not efficient despite setting the temperature to 32C room was dark only small windows overlooking a wall 2m away internet was slow not enough for Skype call  |Positive:  staff was helpful breakfast OK however nothing extraordinary coffee tea set in the room
Negative:  I booked a double room but it turned out to be 2 single beds pushed together We found it very uncomfortable Also the beds had seperate single bed sheets on them so no effort was made to even make it appear like a double bed double sheets at least would have been a start Breakfast instead of new unpealed potatoes chips would be better The sausages were undercooked and the beans were cheap I WAS REALLY DISSAPOINTED when we returned back from breakfast we noticed that someone had came into our room and stolen a mars bar that was on the bedside cabinet It made it worse by the fact it was a double mars bar so someone had torn it open and taken half then just left the other half in the torn wrapper and left it on the table I reported this incident to the duty manager she said she would look into it I really do not expect this kind of thing to happen especially in a reputable place like this It s not the item itself that i m concerned about but it s rather the value of principle  |Positive:  I found staff friendly and a pleasing atmosphere in the building I thought overall the facilities were nice and clean 
Negative:  I can t say anything bad  |Positive:  I work for a 5 star hotel in NYC The staff went above and beyond the front desk staff and bell men are amazing I really felt like I was at home very safe you all gave me 5 star service you are the best 
Negative:  Rooms are very small Not a lot of space even in the deluxe Double mirror is far from Plug so Could not Straighten my hair Shower door did not close properly Too expensive |Positive:  Breakfast was really nice Staff are helpful
Negative:  The room was quite small and the view was quite bad but okay as we only stayed for a night |Positive:  The location was brilliant The duvet and pillows were incredibly comfortable too 
Negative:  To all weary travellers I booked a four night stay at The Park Grand hotel in London Paddington Having just arrived from a long journey and I checked into my room and went straight to bed Not long after drifting off to the land of nod I awoke to a burning sensation severe itchiness to my upper torso neck hands and arms Upon further inspection I soon discovered the bed was riddled with bedbugs and these free loaders I counted in the double digits After contacting reception I was greeted by the hotel manager and an assistant to assess the extent of the infestation By this time my bites had swollen to a collection of bright red bump The manager and equally his assistant were shocked at the state of the bed and they moved me to the room down the hallway The following morning I spoke to another manager to request a full refund for the previous night as well as requested relocation to a lower floor just in case my new friends decided to pay me another visit The manager advised me that a full refund was not practical and that the best they could do for me at the time was to give a 20 discount on the room which I did not accept for the previous evening and wash my clothes to prevent any stowaways At one point throughout the discussion the manager even intimated that I may be responsible for the infestation and that he would investigate the situation adding insult to injury This certainly did put me at ease and I did not feel like a valued customer Instead of giving the hotel the benefit of the doubt and continuing my stay I requested that my room be cancelled and to refund the remaining nights As anticipated I was told that I should give 24 hours notice in order to cancel so I had to stay one more night before leaving to a neighbouring hotel I short the attitude of the hotel was woeful and the manner in which they dealt with their customers albeit the general staff was pleasant and helpful  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Everything was suburb I would consider myself a regular at the hotel and every time I go it is always great service |Positive:  I love the guys for room service as well as the doormen Really friendly and helpful
Negative:  The gym was good but I would have appreciated a yoga mat pilates ball and some more weights |Positive:  Really nice staff at the reception The location was great with walking distance to 3 different subway stations and also it was very close to Hyde park and Kensington Gardens 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Well located between tube stops for many different lines The room is tiny but well thought out to be well equipped The staff were really friendly Pleasant surprise considering the very good price 
Negative:  Bathroom was teeny tiny but very functional clean so not really a didn t like more an observation |Positive:  I was upgraded to a Club Room told at reception it was a bigger room it was very nice room I must admit but not sure what a standard room size looked like to compare
Negative:  Poor Wi Fi connection We missed a cosy lounge There was no where to hang our winter coats in the room Bathroom had not enough room for our toiletries and no toilet brush For a Dane the bread at breakfast was not satisfactory only white and dry  |Positive:  Very nice and helpful staff Though very small the room and bathroom were very nice Good value for money 
Negative:  the bathroom was a mess 4 star hotel with no shower cabine just a shower head and curtain that if you were not carefull flooded the whole room also our room was in the basement  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Smallest room I ve seen in a long time I booked a double deluxe room and it appeared to be one of the smallest rooms looking at the fire escape floor plan Far from impressed  |Positive:  Location was good and convenient for me
Negative:  Our room was in some sort of basement therefore the view was rather disappointing The window showed some kind of patio where the hotel staff walked through to get to the other rooms We had to keep the curtains closed for privacy this was not a really big issue  |Positive:  I came here for a romantic weekend with my boyfriend We were welcomed very warmly by the receptionist The room was really nice a little bit on the small side but very clean and comfortable 
Negative:  So called deluxe double room is claustrophobic It is overpriced but what isn t in London In addition on the web site breakfast was included in reality it s not  |Positive:  Location Good Lebanese restaurant nearby 
Negative:  I was very dissapointed with this property our daughter booked and paid for this as a birthday present we had hassle checking in the receptionist wanted a copy of the card for security as this wasnt our card we didnt have it we offered our own card to use and they wanted to refund our daughters card which would take 10 days and take the money for the room from us there was no reason to do this and was a bad start to our trip Also the pictures are very misleading the rooms were tiny I wouldnt return here but would definitely return to the area |Positive:  The location
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Great location with friendly staff Rooms are clean and modern but small as usual in London hotels Lots of different restaurants in the area such as Lebanese Malaysia Indian Italian Malaysia pubs 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Located conveniently close to Paddington and not too far from Lancaster Gate Comfortable bed room size was really small as stated but ok for 2 days Would visit again 
Negative:  Rooms are much smaller than they look in website Booked a double room for a couple up on check in into room found only one set of things in the room one towel one coffee cup etc Two calls to reception with 20 min wait to get things sorted  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  A bath in the suite is the only thing that would have made it better The hotel was further from Paddington than we d expected |Positive:  Excellent value for money we were upgraded to a suite free of charge so found ourselves in a very comfortable modern and exceptionally clean 4 suite for just over 100 Staff were very helpful organising a cake for my partner s birthday and although we didn t eat at the hotel the Indian food in the bar smelt delicious Room service was very reasonably priced too 
Negative:  Unfortunately the room was too hot to sleep and the air conditioning could not cope with the heat  |Positive:  Clean smart room with a comfortable mattress Friendly staff and an excellent location 
Negative:  There are two of the same franchise in the same street so watch out for that this is the one at the corner of Queens Gardens |Positive:  The hotel was conveniently located between two major tube stations We were due to check for in at 2pm but they let us check in when we arrived at 11am We really only used the hotel as a base we weren t there very much so I can t comment on the facilities or breakfast But I was very satisfied with what we got for what I paid 
Negative:  Room too small with tiniest bathroom Very lengthy check in procedure which involved taking photocopies of my id and credit card For security and other reasons I was not happy about this and it doesn t happen at other hotels  |Positive:  Close to Paddington Could easily walk to Hyde Park tube etc Restaurants shops and great cafes for breakfast close by Clean but tiny room everything you needed but cramped and my husband and I are small Would be fine for a single traveler Great wifi 
Negative:  Bit strange being asked for photo ID to check in I hadn t seen that when booking and just by luck I had my driving licence with me  |Positive:  Getting a proper sized room with a real window at a good price just a few steps from Paddington
Negative:  Room very nice but unfortunately the bed was quite dirty I know this is not the standard of this hotel but I had this unpleasant surprise on my last staying I m sure it won t happen again  |Positive:  Nice hotel near Paddington station
Negative:  No milk in room and called to say late check in and told at check in that my booking was about to be cancelled if any later  |Positive:  Clean great room ground floor and bright
Negative:  Breakfast was poor and uninspiring with limited selection wouldn t bother with it next time Also more expensive to buy it on booking com than at the hotel |Positive:  Good hotel Modern stylish decor and spacious room Very friendly and helpful staff Would definitely revisit 
Negative:  The only down side to the hotel is the beds and pillows First the pillows are like bricks I recommend taking your own pillow if you have to you wake up with sore red ears off them Also the beds are not too comfy could be better I didn t want to think what our room would of been like without the free upgrade But overall for the price I paid which was 153 it wasn t bad as that included breakfast for 2 You can pay a lot more in London for the same service  |Positive:  Staff are very polite and helpful Gave us a free upgrade without asking which was nice Pretty central and not to far on the tube for attractions like Buckingham Palace probably about 15 min train ride Staff also gave us a late check out without charging us which we was made up with as we wasn t leaving London until 7pm Overall good experience
Negative:  This particular hotel has a chain of 3 buildings all in close proximity to each so was not sure if hotel we stayed in was one advertised Also room given to us was on ground floor and curtains covered what was the old main entrance to building no double glazing so extremely noisey |Positive:  Location was ideal only short walk to Paddington train station and restaurants
Negative:  There was no hot water in the hotel so they moved us to another sister hotel down the road This hotel had tiny rooms noisy setup itchy sheets and in the middle of night a couple walked in on me as the reception gave them a key to my room Didn t sleep well Will not stay again |Positive:  Despite the massive problems the staff are very polite and tried to solve the problems 
Negative:  second time i ve visited this hotel First time my husband and i were bumped This time when told they were moving me i stood my ground and insisted they gave me the room i d booked Don t trust them no consideration for woman travelling alone You can imagine my shook and horror as 2 gentlemen came to check in next to me and were given rooms without hesitation or treat o f being moved My checking in experience was so upsetting i did not bother asking for help when my rooms heating wasn t working So I froze all night didn t sleep and felt totally upset when asked on checking out if i d had a good stay i said no and explained why Oh sorry to hear that Bye was the response i recieved from the polite but obviously not empowered reception staff Beware of the dubious checking in policy  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Disappointed that the front desk could not accept a franked letter for posting One front desk person sent me to post box at Paddington while the next day I was directed to a post box just down the street A seemingly insignificant thing but not when one is a visitor to a foreign land  |Positive:  Nice hotel convenient distance from Paddington Station Staff were very friendly and accommodating Room was small but well equipped and comfortable Only stayed here one night but will consider when back in London 
Negative:  We booked this through a third party booking Com Previously to that I had spoken to reservations of shatsbury hotels which indicated to me you have made a perfect choice for the location and purpose of your special occasion surprise to your partners birthday They also stated this is a wonderful boutique hotel and which would meet your needs for this occasion The lady also stated you can book through our selves or the third party If you decided you wish to book through us you will be offered breakfast included in the price How ever I decided to book through third part as the price was a better rate for our selves I had been in contact with the hotel manager and discussed possible arrangements and touches for my partners surprise On arrival all seemed okay had a coffee in bar why waiting for room to be handed over When entering the junior suite room I was astounded in how poor quality and damage of furnishings also dust and extremely cold as well as the cold feel to the room I unfortunately broke down to my partner and had to apologise I had been let down We then went down to reception and spoke with the manager Sophia and explained our concerns of the room Sophia said I can show you another room but it will be smaller and same quality as we re currently going a new refurbishment as of last week I explained I wish I had been told this before How ever Sophia said I will get you moved to the hotel you stayed at before which is Kensington park grande She spoke to reservations to find out and sort out Thinking everything was under full control sadly it turned in to a disaster of a night mare I then took things in to my control by phoning reservations cut the long story short 2 hrs later still got know where really and by now my partner is currently not good health due to waiting for brain surgery has now got stressed and feeling dizzy and sick We went down to reception and finally the gm Natish took us in to club lounge and spoke to us  |Positive:  Location of hotel and not far from station
Negative:  The air conditioner seems not to work because although I adjust it to 32 degrees but actually I felt less than 20 degrees and it was cold during night Also I booked for a double bed but initially it was 2 single beds next to each other Once I asked for a double bed they just put something like mattress protector to cover the gap between the 2 single mattresses  |Positive:  The staff were friendly the room was clean and the bathroom was clean too The breakfast was really good but the restaurant size compared to the number if guests was quite small and everyone was packed to each other 
Negative:  I was dissatisfied with the fact that the shower floor was not sectioned off from the main bathroom floor There was no difference between the shower floor and bathroom floor so to speak  |Positive:  Location and nice view from the room 
Negative:  Poor room service staff reception should be much more pleasant disappointed of their welcome guys try to smile even if the client can t speak english well Room service worst one ever Changing bed and putting same dirty pillows Come on that s not a good service for london |Positive:  L emplacement le quartier
Negative:  This hotel is supposed to be a 4 accommodation However given our experience it can be said it s no more than 2 We booked a deluxe twin room with 2 twin beds When we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed We told the front desk about this They reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds They also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct We were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back First they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other Park hotels When we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this So we had to accept the room anyhow They also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day More interestingly we made the booking in Euros and were charged more than 20 Euros more than our initial booking without any explanation When we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work The heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature Remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet When we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working OK and that we would have to wait to heat up That did not happen the room was only getting colder because the blower just blew cold air Mid januari in London that is not nice We called again and finally somebody came and said there was indeed a malfunction However they told us not being able to repair it until next day  |Positive:  Absolutely nothing 
Negative:  Poor level of cleanliness in my room particularly around the bed and in the frame area of the bed Cooked breakfast was also half cold and not very good  |Positive:  Reasonable sized club room
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Staff very polite and helpful Much better approach to customer service than their Heathrow Hotel Would Definitely Recommend 5 10 10 Experience I used to visit Park Grand Heathrow But No More After Staying At The Paddington Hotel
Negative:  When we got there they told us no room left and try to send us to another unknown hotel and also asking pay first Even tho we book one week ago there s no advance notice or apology explaination I basically stood next to the front desk and watch people check out so eventually got a room With tinny window and on the grand floor hearing people walk passing by  |Positive:  If you wanna stay near paddington in a buget This s good idea But to be honest I wish I just book Hilton instead 
Negative:  We were told at 9pm to keep quiet which was annoying as it was still early and then we got told we could use the club lounge and two minutes later got asked to go back to our room it was just annoying but I wouldn t say it s a place to go with a group of friends if you are planning a night out as it didn t suit us even when being quiet  |Positive:  Location and Value for money
Negative:  Room bed was a bit worn and windows allowed some street noise in so sleeping in was not really an option |Positive:  Great location near Paddington very friendly staff Good simple breakfast Excellent value for the price 
Negative:  N A |Positive:  For the price paid 1 2 normal rate I thought this was a good value hotel Plate of fruit was a nice touch as were the pack of jammy dodgers with the tea and coffee making facilities The room was smallish but well laid out I stayed for one night The location is great and if you re visiting London for the first time this hotel is easily accessible from the train station and tube at Paddington 
Negative:  It would have been useful to have more plug sockets in the room to charge phones etc  |Positive:  The hotel was in a nice quiet location just 5 mins walk from Paddington station The staff were lovely and allowed us to check out very early for our flight at 7am The room was a decent size and very modern with a comfortable bed 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Excelllent view out to Cleveland Square quiet extremely helpful staff at all times of day and evening good furnishings of room 317 Good magazine supply Nice atmosphere in lounge bar Above all the excellent room and its fittings Mind the ingenuity of the designer in fitting so much into the space of 317 made it a very different experience than staying in one of the larger upgraded room suites of my last stay there Both are fine just radically different 
Negative:  The size of the room was very small No cupboard to put away clothing etc There wasn t any dressing table not enough room in the bathroom to display any toiletries  |Positive:  The staff were really friendly especially Sara We would definitely come and stay here again because of her 
Negative:  Curtains as mentioned above  |Positive:  Great staff and value for money Hotel was lovely although there were a few stains on the curtains This did not bother me that much however other guests may not be so forgiving 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Ideal location for Paddington station and the parks And only a good walk to the west end weather permitting Greeting from the reception was friendly and welcoming Rooms were small but well appointed Lack of bath in rooms was a little disappointing but shower was good No public space to relax Apart from a sofa in reception and a very small bar We didn t eat breakfast But the food we saw looked very good The staff in all departments were polite knowledgeable and helpful as well as looking smart and sharp We as a family enjoyed our time here
Negative:  For the first timers the location would be confusing as there were many hotels in the same name of Park Grand in around the same location Its hard to find your way back by walking if you forget the landmarks The Bathroom is very small congested  |Positive:  Best Value for Money in a Hotel in London within a walkable distance to Oxford street The Reception staff were excellent the boys were probably the best in UK as they handled our luggage all the way during check in checkout Room is small but good 
Negative:  I didnt had a bad experience |Positive:  I like the quality of service room decoration staff was friendly Moreover they provided me storage option which was very comfortable specially if you have trains to heathrow Overall i had a great experience staying there 
Negative:  Very bad and small rooms Payment sistem in hotel didn t accept visa electron card But before that when I booked room they accept  |Positive:  Noting Just location 
Negative:  Noise from everywhere in the hotel even uf someone walk un the upper floor or flush water in toilet breakfas is not good they gave us differen building becouse we whete told there is no water in the hotel well not stat again |Positive:  Nothing
Negative:  Extra charge of 45 on leaving as they made a mistake when giving me price for room and breakfast a nice way to make extra money Noisy water pipes no ear plugs at hotel reception |Positive:  Clean
Negative:  Air con was very noisy in the night even when switched off Could hear tv in the room next door |Positive:  Lovely room open and bright Very clean and appreciated complimentary wine water fruit Staff were lovely and friendly Lovely warm dressing gowns Great location Well deserved 4 hotel Would definitely stay here again
Negative:  Very compact room Dark decor made room appear smaller Location of hair dryer strange  |Positive:  Location good Staff friendly helpful Facilities in room good
Negative:  There was a double and single bed in our room for 3 adults There were no rooms with three single beds so two of my friends had to share which was uncomfortable for them  |Positive:  The staff were friendly and helpful 
Negative:  The room was uncomfortably small When showering the water came through the bathroom door and got the carpet wet causing a bad smell |Positive:  Staff and breakfast were excellent
Negative:  Air conditioning wasn t great Where the hairdryer was situated in our room was convenient for the mirror You had to perch at the top of the bed to dry your hair as you couldn t detach the hairdryer to move it to a more convenient plug The mirror pulled out an angle to the bed The mattress was 2 smaller ones pushed together and this meant there was more bed stead than mattress and you found yourself walking into the sides of the bed all the time The shower door only opened half way which meant you had to manoeuvre between that and the towel rail on the right hand side which didn t leave much room Whilst the style of the room was very nice the dark wood was very dark Didn t like the fact I had to hand over photo ID and the Receptionist was unable to answer why when I asked only that it was hotel policy which is fine but why She took my credit card to confirm I was the one that made the booking my partner wasn t asked to show any ID and what if I didn t have ID would I not be allowed to check in despite me having pre paid the room Not happy about this information being available hence why I requested the copy back on departure Small Bar facilities at the hotel with very limited choice of draught beverages  |Positive:  I loved the location staff were friendly and hotel was really nice 
Negative:  At first the room that was given to us was not the luxury double that was booked It was a very small room But the staff kindly moved us into a bigger room and apologised for the inconvenience  |Positive: No Positive
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Excellent Quiet modern rooms air con great shower room service friendly staff and 12pm checkout All for a good price Will definitely be staying here again 
Negative:  The second room for our family was not as close as we would have liked despite requesting rooms together Staff were perfunctory and showed no interest whatsoever in us or in enhancing our stay in London When asked to call a taxi they arranged an Uber car and the driver did not know how to get to the destination a tube station so my husband had to use his own phone to navigate Expensive for what we got  |Positive:  Comfortable and clean Walking distance from train stations 
Negative:  My partner dropped a new earring in the bathroom sink and it could apparently not be retrieved without a plumber This would have cost us more than it was worth so it stayed in the u bend I believe it could have been accessed without much difficulty using a Phillips screwdriver but who carries one  |Positive:  Comfortable well fitted room with particularly nice bathroom and shower Comfortable bed Quiet room and very friendly staff 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We stayed here before and found the location to be excellent for getting about central London Central line tube and bus stop only a 4 5 min walk and plenty of places to eat and drink in all directions Considering the location it is pretty quiet at night This time we opted for a club room which was pretty large and well worth the relatively small extra cost We have stayed in lots of places in London but will definitely stay here again 
Negative:  Nothing |Positive:  I enjoyed my time in the hotel everything were perfect and great breakfast was very well the staff very kindly especially tina and diana I will stay more and more in that hotel again 
Negative:  The staff wasn t friendly when I was checking in She didn t even smile After that someone else was given the same room as us after we checked in Then we cannot get into our room with the key  |Positive:  Even though our room was at the basement the room was open and spacious enough for two people It wasn t an incovenience at all We were given complimentary drinks for the room key incident 
Negative:  The fact that we were transfered to another building 5 minutes away because of maintenance issues The room and bathroom are very small in size The shower box is literally the size of a single cupboard  |Positive:  Fairly clean rooms 
Negative:  The evening receptionist Desmond on the night of the 8th to the 9th of December handled a situation very badly when his colleagues earlier on in the day had given us permission to use the lounge room until pick up by shuttle to the airport at 4am he came to inform us that we could not stay in the hotel unless we book a room He apologized after upsetting us but it was a bit too late  |Positive:  The shower and the door men
Negative:  Disappointed that I couldn t cancel my breakfast but was offered a take away Although I didn t have time for it I did take out an excellent coffee  |Positive:  Great location for an early Heathrow Express train 
Negative:  I stayed twice so far each time in the standard double room Once was in an attic and that room was a lot more tight for space than the other Both fairly usually small for an inner city hotel room The Attic room lights were bright with no lamp but the other room had better mood lighting  |Positive:  Located close to Paddington station but on a quiet street clean and comfy decent bed decent bathroom friendly staff 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The hotel was lovely clean modern and comfortable Despite a problem with the water they moved us to their sister hotel which was only a stones throw away and gave us complimentary breakfast for the entire stay to say sorry We also had our rooms upgraded and following another misunderstanding with the room booking the staff could not do enough for us to make it right The customer service was superb During our stay our pregnant friend was really ill and the hotel manager Lizzie personally cared for her and the hotel driver escorted her to back and to to the nearest hospital The customer service here was first class and I would highly recommend it I can t thank them enough for how well they looked after us I would defo stay here again

Negative:  The first night I was booked to a tiny double bedroom 033 on the ground floor and unfortunately you could hear all night cars driving and pedestrians walking by Also the room wasn t very good isolated and you could see the light from the corridor outside and the corridor door opening and shut Also the housekeeping team must have had nearby their cleaning cupboards so from 07 00am you heard loud voices and the vacuum cleaner going on The bathroom in this room was designed for a disabled wheel chair person which is ok but I felt it was a bit small and the shower was not warming up and the water pressures was low so it took ages to wash off soap etc however after i complained to the front staff about the noise and the water they put me in one of their club rooms which was better and the water pressure in the shower was good Overall I stayed in the hotel for three nights and it was a good experience |Positive:  Executives club rooms were modern furnished clean and beds are comfortable

Negative:  Dreadful staff who would not help despite their booking process being unclear They need the card you book the room under to be present at check in which is useless for corporate bookings They will not take card payment over the phone or web because of fraud but would be happy to take a payment from the same card if you didn t turn up Happy to leave two guests waiting in reception with no access to room whilst this was resolved Really bad experience won t be booking again They also want to photocopy your driving license and bank card and try to tell you that you have to sign up to their loyalty club  |Positive:  Rooms comfortable and clean Good facilities Good location
Negative:  Stairs our room is located between the ground and the 1st floor so no direct lift access We had to carry our big suitcases from stairs Gladly the hotel staffs were really helpful with our luggages The room was a bit narrow but perfectly acceptable given the price and being in London  |Positive:  Location is the best being close to the Paddington Station makes everything a lot easier The room is perfectly clean staffs were friendly and helpful Great breakfast

Negative:  Uuufhh Where do I even start The rooms have no space you feel confined in them You can hear the person next door through the walls The hotel is a long walk from the nearest station The housekeeping lady kept coming into my room without knocking on my door she came 4 times between 11 and 12 noon her excuse she wanted to clean the room even though I told her not come in again The hotel should be 2 star and I don t know how they were rated 4 star Perhaps it is self acclaimed I wouldn t advise anyone to go there you ll regret it and wish you hadn t A word they say is enough for the wise but these are alot of words  |Positive:  The porter was the only good in the hotel He was so helpful and courteous I even gave him a tip 
Negative:  Look at the curtains looks like blood stains all over even though it may be chemicals I hope Also you pulled money ahead of time which I wasnt informed of as it stood that the full amount would be paid at the property  |Positive:  Location

Negative:  The room was small and gloomy with dark panelling and inconvenient lighting It looked out into a tiny well and was badly overlooked by another room so I had to keep the curtains closed more gloom I assume I was given the room because I was travelling alone but I booked for 2 people and I was paying the same as 2 people I don t appreciate being treated as a 2nd class citizen  |Positive:  I liked the location the star were efficient but not particularly friendly and lacked the personal approach except the barman 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  fab boutique hotel gr8 location very near hyde park paddington tube station very helpful staff also the reservations rep Mandeep really looked after my stay room upgrade plus wine beverages fruits in my room
Negative:  May be the Restaurant Bar must extend the close hours  |Positive:  Very Friendly Staff specially Lucia who helps us with all our req Great Location Comfortable Rooms 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  I ve stayed in some 500 hotels in my life This one stands out due the hospitality of the staff We felt truly welcome and it made our stay so nice 
Negative:  The double deluxe room was not like the picture it s very small and I felt like I was in a prison cell when I complained the staff did their best to upgrade me to a bigger room however I did feel like it was false advertising to begin with we requested one of the rooms to have 2 single beds they called this a twin room and made us pay 50 more for 2 nights however it was still a double bed or as they call it 2 single beds on one base not sure what the point of that is  |Positive: No Positive
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  well looked after by the staff nothing was to much trouble Room was good except bathroom a bit small but hey who spends all there time in the loo would deff stay again
Negative:  Got to the hotel we booked and needed to be moved elsewhere We were not happy with the hotel we were moved to as a group and this review reflects that hotel the Montcalm  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The location is far away in terms of walking to marble arch oxford and regent street There is a hotel almost have the same name with one word different in the end of the road which makes the taxis some times lost and confused Not enough electric socket and not close to bed for phone charging The room is too small comparing to other hotels with the same class Not recommended to families due to small rooms Check there official website before book via booking com as some times you will find it cheaper and comes with breakfast  |Positive:  Friendly Staff fast internet without password and very close to paddington station
Negative:  We had a problem at reception when we arrived which was never resolved to our satisfaction  |Positive:  Despite our room being in the basement a new concept for us it was large and comfortable
Negative:  Room was tiny marginally bigger than the bed and more importantly there was no where to put anything be it my bag or even just a hair brush The bathroom is what is euphemistically known as a wet room meaning everything gets soaked when you have a shower You therefore have to plan your morning routine carefully unless you don t mind cleaning your teeth while standing in a puddle  |Positive:  The bed was comfortable enough 
Negative:  The bathroom If it can be called that even Honestly it is just a cubicle with no demarcation for the shower just a shower curtain that you pull across but that certainly does not help as for sure there is water everywhere on the floor when you shower We had to put down 3 towels to soak it all up as it s a mess they could surely have increased the size by cutting down on the seating area of the room It was really very tiny though we were in the Club Room  |Positive:  1 It is really convenient to get on the Paddington Express from Heathrow walk down to the hotel It is just under 10mins 2 It s in a peaceful street with very friendly efficient staff quick to meet our requests 3 Lots of shops restaurants close by so convenient 4 comfortable bed pillows fluffy quilts very clean free wi fi 5 the bikkies everyday are a nice touch though if they had provided botlled water that too would have been good not so expensive for them

Negative:  I was setting in the Reception Reception staff they are not respecting the customer they are saying to some customer at 2 clock you can get the key and other giving them the key When I spoke to her she said we have categories I told her I know you have categories when first customer came I kept quite because they are 2 but when you allow for other single customer to get the key that mean there is no management and no respect for customer and that not fair she didn t give me any answer just said wait 15 min it will reach 2 and you will get the key after 5 min asking me to get the they how she arranged they faster The reception is the front of the hotel if the employee s behavior is abusive the owner will be looses My evidence hotel camera  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  An unpleasant smell in bathrooms due to style of plumbing and in some rooms wet room means that bathroom floor can be rather wet  |Positive:  Position next to Paddington Station Breakfast is excellent Evening meals are available

Negative:  got a basement room with no natural light Tiny room tiny wadrobe inside a wall and they could do smth with unused space from the entrance to the room  |Positive:  good location good breakfast
Negative:  The size of a double deluxe room was small and I had rather claustrophobic impression No fulfilment of my preliminary request The bathroom floor gets totally flooded One chair only in a double room The same foods served in breakfast evryday and poor choice  |Positive:  The location of the hotel is great 
Negative:  There was nothing to complain about  |Positive:  My wife had to recover from hip surgery before returning to our country This hotel was perfect for that the staff great and helpful I particularly acknowledge great assistance from Tania at the reception desk 
Negative:  Toilet seat had hair on it the two rooms were not very close together and they were rather cramped  |Positive:  It was a short overnight stop so the rooms were adequate
Negative:  The room was tiny To put this into perspective we are two 30 yr old females who have travelled quite a bit and have used various standards of accomadation from hostels upwards so it s not like we re accustomed to luxury I ve also been in London a number of times so I understand hotel rooms are small in general Knowing this we paid a bit extra for a deluxe double as it was supposed to have more room but the bed was a standard double in size and there was only bare walking room on one side and at the end and you could just about stand on the other side of it We actually found it massively amusing trying to figure out what was deluxe about the room  |Positive:  The location was good close to two tube stations one of them being Paddington so easy to get around The shower was fantastic The area was quiet very little street noise Spotlessly clean 
Negative:  We had to change rooms as the ac did not work and they did not fix it Staff could hardly understand English and I thought I was in London but English is not the language  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Reception staff very poor service not friendly not helpful I feel we got fooled with a few things only because the staff in the reception didn t inform us about things like if you prebook your breakfast at the reception the day before is only 9 not more as we got charged when we went down in the restaurant if you ask them to call you a cab they call you a private kind of a chauffeur service which is more expensive then the usual London cabs etc We booked a room for 3 people in a small room there was a double bed and a very uncomfortable sofa one of us had to sleep on that on the sofa Also had a few issues with the charges on my credit card in the hotel they were not helpful they didn t give me any explanation they gave me an email to email them I wouldn t trust them again with my credit card  |Positive:  It was a lovely hotel very small from the photos looks bigger 5 minutes from the underground station 
Negative:  Wish the rooms were a bit bigger We booked a triple room They gave us the one facing the back of the hotel which was very claustrophobic It was so bad we were going to leave the hotel but then they showed us their other triple room which faces the front street of the hotel and that was much better But generally very claustrophobic rooms My teenage kids didn t like it as they need their space  |Positive:  The rooms are small yet fully equipped with everything we needed Service excellent staff very friendly and helpful rooms are clean
Negative:  The room was too small bathroom sink was clogged and electrical sockets did not work so I could not charge by mobile phone I changed my hotel to Grand Park Court around the block  |Positive:  Location of the hotel 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The quiet street central location beautiful boutique hotel room friendly staff excellent housekeeping who reacted quickly to requests for extra milk for the coffee very good value price for a hotel in such a location and only 10 minutes walk from Paddington and the Heathrow Express The hotel also helped me to organise a surprise for my new husband in our room which was decorated with petals and roses The service is very personal and was very very much appreciated by us both 
Negative:  TINY room and I mean tiny Literally just enough room for a bed Lipstick on wine glasses 4 days in a row so not cleaned properly air con has one setting only Arctic and loud  |Positive:  Within 10 minutes walk of Paddington station which has the underground availability 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Excellent location staff were very warm welcoming helpful Was pleasantly surprised at the room size very spacious for a city hotel tea coffee facilities fridge in room Would highly recommend definitely return

Negative:  had to ask for complimentary items that should have been included in our room hairdryer situation was poor couldn t see in a mirror without being a contortionist no explanation of facilities and their location |Positive:  The location to Hyde Park
Negative:  Extremely small rooms though not surprising for Central London you can barely move within the ground floor rooms Either misleading pictures on booking com or the hotel gave us their smallest rooms knowing we re travelling with children  |Positive:  Location is very convenient
Negative:  1 The steep steps leading to my room 2 THe lack of a cloth to cover the bread stick as you cut it thus your hand and anyonelses was placed on the end of the bread to steady it as you cut  |Positive:  FRiendly efficient staff Immaculate facilities with top quality linens etc The position of the hotel in relation to public transport 
Negative:  Upon check in I was asked to move to a sister property Apparently my room was under rennivation the sister property room was a shoebox size They miraculously found a room for me at the first hotel and the room was extremely small Incredibly dirty I will not be back I checked out after one night and paid a penalty fee I will not be back  |Positive:  Front desk Staff were very nice and attentive 
Negative:  I booked a double deluxe room here online but when I got there they gave me a small room the size of a closet because it was available first even though I had paid the price point for a double deluxe room 450 pounds a night They then transferred me to a slightly bigger room that still wasn t a double deluxe and looked nothing like in the pictures Staff were rude and reluctant to help whenever spoken to and at one point in the lounge area we witnessed one of the staff giving a young hotel guest a loud and stern lecture about payment the whole exchange was very uncomfortable and unprofessional For 450 pounds night 800 Canadian dollars we would have gotten a spacious room in other countries with wonderful service but here I felt like I had thrown a bunch of money down the drain  |Positive:  The place was nicely furnished in a compact way 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The staff were all polite helpful and friendly We stayed in a Junior Suite and the room was everything you would want if away from all home comforts really comfortable and in a quiet location considering it s London The breakfast was excellent plentiful and tasty Would definitely stay there again 
Negative:  They changed us two times from one hotel to another when we arrived They offered us complimentary breakfast The drawback is that the bathroom was very small and it smells bad sometimes  |Positive:  Good locaci n near several underground stations Easy to arrive to tourist places 
Negative:  Deluxe double was a small room Interior was back to the 70s TV was small and hardly viewable Front line staff were great but the managers appeared as honest as Arthur Daley No room for luggage Bathroom too small |Positive:  5 mins walk to Paddington station and tube lines Plenty of shops and resturants nearby Rooms were clean good wifi
Negative:  Reception was a nightmare When we arrived they put into a room which NOT what we ordered and they were more concerned with taking our money than providing a service Treated us like B grade guests because we had booked using Booking com We asked them to book a taxi for us on departure and they booked a cab for the wrong time Would not stay there again  |Positive:  Room was clean when we asked them to move us to the room we had reserved they agreed after a debate 
Negative:  The room and bathroom shower was very small and quite claustrophobic  |Positive:  Pleased with the complimentary breakfasts probably should be included for the price 
Negative:  rooms are slightly small so if you have a big luggage hard to move and no space to unpack some of the stuff had an attitude i had a big window in the room but looking to back side of the street so no nice view  |Positive:  very neat and clean good wifi easy access to subway station 5 to 7 minutes by walk breakfast was ok hotel is on a quiet street some of the stuff was helpful and smiling 
Negative:  The room was a Club It was ridiculously small in that it was a struggle to walk round the end of the bed Anyone more than 6ft 3 tall would be struggling with the low ceiling height The bathroom was a toilet basin with a shower which had a curtain ridiculously small it is not a wet room The mattress dipped in the middle so an uncomfortable 2 nights sleep Overall we felt that we had been charged a lot more than it was worth As a regular genius booker with booking com we ware disappointed not to have been alerted to these problems as we would have stayed elsewhere  |Positive:  Location 
Negative:  We had asked for a nice room as we were celebrating our 6 month wedding anniversary but we were given a room down in basement level which obviously meant no view Then the bed consisted of two single mattresses pushed together on a wooden base which was far too big for purpose The room was smaller than we expected to get for the 436 we paid for the two nights Also the shower tray is pretty much on the same level as the bathroom floor so if you re in the shower any longer than a couple of minutes the bathroom floor gets totally flooded All in all definitely not worth the money we paid  |Positive:  The location is good everything is nice and handy to get to from this Hotel which is it s only saving grace in my opinion 
Negative:  Unfortunately there was not enough storage space in our room One small hanging space and two small bedside drawers is not enough for a stay of three nights It meant that we were not even able to partially unpack our cases I would have liked more space for our personal toiletries in the bathroom as well  |Positive:  We were very impressed with the hotel and staff We were in London for our son s university graduation and were allowed a late check out for his room so that he could come back afterwards to change clothes and rest The gesture was much appreciated 
Negative:  NOT the room type we ordered and paid for Two very single mattress made up individually on a king size wooden bed base does not equal a double bed Room was nice but not in our opinion a deluxe  |Positive:  Location to Paddington station hotel is quick and easy to get to but still in a quiet street Breakfast hot tasty and plentiful ALL staff we met were friendly and helpful 
Negative:  Rooms are too small not enough or to be correct almost no wardrobe space and a useless entry space without even a few hooks that area could be used at least to hang your coat hat or a few stuff |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  A room with a broken and leaking shower should not be given to guests Neither the reservation system nor the receptionists do understand that a female guest s family name can consist of two parts like maiden name plus husband s name while the respective husband has just one name This lead to the problem that an important parcel has not been accepted for which my husband was eagerly waiting Instead it was sent back by the receptionist  |Positive:  We had the benefit of being upgraded because of a broken shower in the room originally booked Excellent indian restaurant very friendly and normally helpful staff good continental breakfast for a good price Large number of staff Lot of storage room due to clever use of space 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The staff made us feel welcome and valued immediately Were given upgrade and complementary breakfasts due to maintenance work Room was immaculate and very comfortable Very close to underground and Hyde Park Would stay here again

Negative:  The toilet was very small On the day we checked in the walk in price was less than what we paid on booking com I would definitely call the hotel to check the price before booking  |Positive:  we had a junior suite which had a luggage room in it which was excellent The bed was comfortable and the room was neat and clean 
Negative:  The room was awful Too small very claustrophobic awful view |Positive:  Reception is lovely but very deceptive as rooms do not measure up We stayed room 328 very dusty carpet coming up near door Bathroom shower not clean Bathroom so small you could hardly get out of shower Would not stay again

Negative:  We had arranged to have a continental breakfast my husband changed his mind When checking out the manager charged us the difference for 3 people having a full English breakfast When challenged and asked for a receipt the manager rudely passed threw the receipt to my husband My husband asked he why he did it and was ignored A sad ending to an otherwise very enjoyable stay  |Positive:  The size of the room Comfort of bed most of the staff were extremely helpful proximity to Edgware road Toiletries and facilities in room 
Negative:  The size of the room is definitely smaller than the description Befor arriving they informed us that the room we booked had something wrong so they will transfer us to their sister hotel which is two minutes walk We rejected and the first night they arranged us to a room at basement floor which was horriable I think it is because of overbook The hotel is not very clean And at the 7th day the toilet flush button also didn t work well  |Positive:  The location 10 mins walk from rail station and tube station and the Hilton hotel Two tips our booking is not free cancelled one so the hotel charged all the fee before arriving No slippers The shower is good 
Negative:  The room we had was in basement so no phone signal which was a pain |Positive:  Location for paddington station excellent the room had everything you could need for a quiet stay in london and easy access to central london perfect stay for a 2 night break
Negative:  The walk in shower as the floor was always flooded  |Positive:  Friendly receptionist showed me how to get to the harry potter studios Bell boy also just as helpful The breakfast was good 
Negative:  There was absolutely no insolation between the room and corridor I was woken constantly through the night especially with people coming back in the early hours of the morning and arguing for several hours I travel extensively and this is the worst hotel I ve stayed at due to the noise factor  |Positive:  Location
Negative:  The experience was very bad staff unprofessional especially the reception Bad Bad Bad room service This hotel dont deserve to be 4 stars at all max 2 5 stars  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The bathroom was ridiculous There was no tub or shower door just a curtain and a drain in the middle of the floor so when you showered water soaked the entire bathroom floor surface  |Positive:  The staff was very nice and accommodating 
Negative:  Initially we were provided with two very poor rooms Neither had curtains only blinds which did not close properly The compact room was extremely small and had a musty smell The deluxe double could in no way be described as deluxe Among other things the carpet at the entrance of the shower room was very wet  |Positive:  Upon complaining via Booking com we were invited to look at two other rooms The staff dealt with this very professionally As we were staying for only one night we decided to remain at the hotel and moved rooms Both of these were much more acceptable 
Negative:  The rooms were incredibly small and cramped We struggled to even get through the door to our room The rooms were not clean there were very big brown stains on the carpet The hotel is dated and the fixtures including the thermostat were falling off the wall in some cases  |Positive:  The location is very good and is only a five minute walk from Paddimgton Station and is also very close to shops and restaurants

Negative:  Not only did the staff on arrival ask to copy the details of my credit card this is OK but they also noted down the CVV number from the back of the credit card This means that the hotel has all the information to use my credit card for internet purchases Since this is unacceptable I asked the receptionist to delete the CVV but she refused This policy should be changed Otherwise good hotel  |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  Nothing to declare  |Positive:  The hotel brings a high style of modernity and glamour The staff is always ready to help in anything and the amazing location between the turistic and business area in Paris 
Negative:  No gym as its being refurbed which was not clear on the site apart from right at the bottom Also I was not allowed to then change hotel after I discovered this when i brought it up with the staff in the morning who were a little short I was then emailed far to late saying I could change but by that time I was already at work Also you changed the price of the booking the second night to add insult because of demand which apparently was on the site too Absolute joke how you can get away with that  |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  Location not far from Gard de Nord otherwise somewhat out of the way until we found our way around the Metro which was good Breakfast not impressive little choice coffee not hot Bar had limited opening times closed early so no customers no atmosphere D cor seating was good so if the management put some effort into it would do a lot better Ice Bar was a great novelty but at 18C we didn t fancy it perhaps next time we will brave it Also a kettle in the room would be helpful  |Positive:  Room was very modern spacious Bed extremely comfortable Shower brilliant Staff very helpful

Negative:  Limited food available from the reception bar  |Positive:  Staff very friendly and helpful location perfect for getting anywhere we needed to go in Paris and decor of the hotel was cool 
Negative:  Booking com advertised my room as having a bath however it didn t The TV didn t work meaning the wifi didn t work Advised staff of both issues and received no offer of resolution Acted as though because it was a last minute booking due to Eurostar cancellation that it was my problem and I should just make do Very sub standard |Positive:  Cool room decorations were very gaudy

Negative:  We didn t have a bad experience but the location seems a little unsafe at night WLking in the day is fine but I would be more inclined to take a taxi at night There were a lot of youths and homeless out drinking This is unfortunately out of the hands of the hotel  |Positive:  The hotel is a great boutique hotel The rooms are great and the hotel staff where helpful and friendly 
Negative:  Fitness club was out of order which was the only reason I booked this particular hotel for the price The staff were vague about the situation and it never got fixed during our 5 day stay And there are no parks nearby for running There were some strangely quirky aspects to the room layour that didn t make sense like a shower with no door or curtain which left an inch of water on the bathroom carpet There was no drain in the floor and all of this meant we could only take baths all week  |Positive:  The staff were nice and it s a very funky hotel with a night club decor but sort of well done The Ice Bar is a must

Negative:  1 The hotel was redecorating it was not like the pictures shows it can be barely recognized 2 It was a long way from elevator to my room lots of doors just imagine you are carrying one or two suitcases and you still have to open the doors again and again when you walking through a very long way besides nobody is intending to help you terrible experience 3 The in room breakfast was not on time I was almost late on the morning 4 Very old decorations not clean enough 5 It was definitely not worth for the price  |Positive:  The location is great just near Russel Sq Station 
Negative:  Noise from the air conditioning units We may not be able to afford a room once the improvements are completed |Positive:  The location was superb and the staff friendly and helpful There are improvements currently underway but it had little impact We had a with no view and noise from the air conditioning but that was probably a reflection on the price we paid

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  All staff especially Miles on reception were professional and friendly and the rooms were well kept Lounge and Bar arrears felt comfortable and relaxing 
Negative:  Sink in bathroom extremely small We were asked for our champagne to room and didnt appear so had to get on check out Also found it very disappointing to be asked to pay for room service on the spot and not able to put on room bill we were very offended by this we have stayed in hotels all over the world and never been asked to do this before In fact had returned from a wonderful holiday in Hong Kong just the week before and had room service and paid on check out Would appreciate some feed back on this matter |Positive:  Enjoyed room service twice very quick and delicious food Comfy bed Lovely breakfast
Negative:  Nothing at all  |Positive:  Awesome historic building conveniently located next to the underground Staff specifically Miles was incredibly friendly and made our stay an experience 
Negative:  I have stayed at the hotel at least half a dozen times over the past three years The rooms are getting tired and worn The front desk staff are indifferent I tried to break a 50 note at front desk so I could tip the waitress in dining room at breakfast they told me to do it myself at one of the nearby restaurants Major exterior renos going on outside hotel I hope they are going to upgrade the rooms as well I think it is time that I try another hotel  |Positive:  The location of the hotel is amazing You are easy walking distance to all of the London attractions and to the city The old doorman has been here for years a Welcoming face for sure

Negative:  I had requested a quiet room Given room on the 6th floor air conditioning not cooling room but extremely noisy room very hot Blocked bath drain shower faulty water filling the bath from the bath tap while shower on Requested room change Given Room on 2nd floor Windows blocked out no daylight Extreme noise from continual external exhaust fans between 5am until 11pm Worst sleep ever Old noisy air conditioning system also Hotel undergoing major building works not advised of this When booking I booked for 3 nights and wanted to cancel the last night to go elsewhere but hotel unable to advise about cancellation as I had made the booking through Booking com  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The bed was huge plenty of room but the mattress was extremely hard and slightly bowed Both my husband I had an uncomfortable nights sleep woke in the morning with aching backs which was a first for both of us  |Positive:  The hotel was clean and the room was well knitted out shower brilliant The staff were lovely 
Negative:  see adjacent box  |Positive:  Breakfast was not fresh Potatoes the standard fried triangles were stale and over fried Pastries were not fresh and gave off a stale taste I m comparing the Russell Hotel breakfast buffet to that at the Euston Hilton Hotel at Upper Woburn which was excellent 
Negative:   |Positive:  Fabulous service Gorgeous old world charm Modem spacious room Loved having such a helpful doorman Every day after a busy day of sightseeing how wonderful to be greeted by cold water infused with fresh fruit at the reception counter 
Negative:  The room was a bit small but that s a function of the hotel maintaining the Victorian style we liked Work on the hotel was in progress while we were there so the machine sounds in the lobby were deafening at times  |Positive:  We generally loved this hotel We d passed it and admired its statuesque grandeur when we d been in Bloomsbury before So we thought we d try staying there The location is excellent so close to a tube stop that even with baggage getting in from Heathrow was do able The hotel s Victorian style has been maintained so noticing the dragon sculpture on the staircase a twin to the one lost on the Titanic and other unique period features the staircase itself the chandelier etc was a delight every time we left our room The staff was very helpful 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The Hotel Russell is a rare survivor of a bygone era Few hotels today can match the historical opulence of the Russell Hotel It is worth a visit if only to have a drink at the bar

Negative:  The rooms are dingy and in serious need of an upgrade with chipped furniture and old fittings  |Positive:  Great central location and a monument to Victorian grandeur on the architecture of the hotel 
Negative:  The hotel was being renovated which gave it a slightly run down appearance The sink in our room was cracked and there was no hair conditioner available in the hotel The television was very small and dated  |Positive:  The staff were particularly friendly and helpful It was our 25th wedding anniversary which came out in conversation when we checked in We were surprised and delighted to find a card a bottle of champagne and 2 delicious cakes beautifully presented in our room on the day This was a very thoughtful and kind gesture which would encourage us to pay a return visit 
Negative:  N A |Positive:  Staff were really friendly and they catered to all our needs Everything was very clean our requests were all fulfilled which made this an extra special stay for a birthday I couldn t fault a single thing

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Hotel Russell is my preferred hotel in London The Piccadilly line takes you from the airport directly to the hotel Russell station and then you are in the central part of London close to the British Museum and many historic sites The hotel itself is historic and charming and is undergoing renovations The only downside is the lack of airconditioning the room did have a fan 
Negative:  Shower was a bit different to work taps slightly broken and the tap you pull up was broken  |Positive:  Very clean and comfortable good location Breakfast was very good fresh food 
Negative:  We chose that hotel because of its locations but the room was an interior one and the view was awful which was very disappointing Interior rooms shouldn t cost the same money The Windows weren t closing and some parts need refurbishment  |Positive:  The location was good and it is easy to get to the main attractions in London from there 
Negative:  After checking out I left my luggage at the concierge However when I returned I had to wait or over 20 minutes before I got my items as the concierge was elsewhere This resulted in me nearly missing my train  |Positive:  Good clean room which reflects what was promised on the photos Take note not all rooms have the old grand baths 
Negative:  Hotel has clearly done a deal with golden tours bus tours we asked the concierge if he could recommend us a good bus tour he sold us tickets for the golden tours busses The tour was abysmal and not worth the time or money we spent on it Breakfast was poor just a buffet food was a bit cold luckily we hadn t had to pay for breakfast bc the hotel had made a mistake with our room so they gave us free breakfast in return but if we had paid I d have been complaining about the breakfast to the staff in charge  |Positive:  Great location friendly staff lovely room although a bit on the small side for a twin room Very lovely building with real character gorgeous stair case and chandelier 
Negative:  There was no water in the room and we had to pay 10 for two bottles from the bar  |Positive:  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and made our stay work like clockwork Likewise the building works had no negative impact on our stay The hotel is well located for both Euston and St Pancras station and of course the British Museum

Negative:  Rooms and bathrooms larger and better air conditioning  |Positive:  The hotel was designed by the person who designed the Titanic and the downstairs and architecture was incredibly grand The rooms and bathrooms were pretty small Bernard the concierge was excellent 
Negative:  Breakfast was horribly overpriced We were offered option for reduced rate of we bought breakfast every morn of our visit but we couldn t do this because we had to leave early the day we departed  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The fire drill that takes place every Monday at 1 00 pm After a transatlantic flight we were asleep when the alarm went off  |Positive:  The building is beautiful and the staff were helpful and friendly Euston Station is a 10 minute walk away and Oxford St shopping close by 
Negative:  nothing really |Positive:  Rooms small compared to previous stays but comfortable with plenty of amenities We did move one room as there was no door chain and air conditioner very noisy Staff are incredibly helpful and pleasant Concierge had the doorman walk our luggage to the Underground And a restaurant designed by the designer of the Titanic 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  I highly recommend this hotel Excellent value for money in central London The architecture and the decor is remarkable My room was spacious with a high ceiling and large bay windows And the bed was very comfortable In addition to that the customer service was superb from the waiters to the Hotel Manager And it was great to see the Receptionist Cohen who has the perfect combination of impeccable manners with friendly professionalism 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  An incredibly comfortable bed in a really well appointed room And Cohen the Receptionist was highly professional friendly and polite Excellent hotel 
Negative:  The bed was extremely uncomfortable The mattress is very soft to the point where if you aren t sleeping in the middle of the bed you might fall off of it I woke up with back pains as well We ended up switching hotels because of it There was no dresser to put your clothes in which was also kind of a bummer Other than that the hotel is old so if you like something modern it s not that Personally that didn t really bother me  |Positive:  The hotel is clean The staff is very friendly The room was relatively big so I had space to move around The staff is super friendly and the Location is perfect The tube is extremely close and while you usually have to switch trains the fact that the station is small and easy to get around is a big bonus For example you might think that being close to Kings Cross is a better location but that station is huge and just to get in and out of it is at least 10 minutes and that s if you get the exit right Switching trains is very easy and convenient and in my opinion should not be taking into consideration when choosing a location It s also located in front of Russel Square Park which is very nice 
Negative:  Not unique to The Russell but I dislike being charged a discretionary service charge of 12 5 and also asked to leave a gratuity on the bill  |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  Hotel is very tired We had a twin bedded room which faced an interior courtyard Windows very dirty outside Tiles in the bathroom needed grouting Room service extremely limited  |Positive:  Good location 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Location is amazing for travel from Heathrow and to visit most sites in London Very near a tube station on one of the best tube lines Coffee shops beside the hotel

Negative:  Nothing It was a lovely but small room in London with a good view But had everything we needed Would definitely stay again  |Positive:  Perfect location for our morning spent at the British Museum 
Negative:  Building is old and has a very small lift however great staircase  |Positive:  Great location tube station around corner plenty of restaurants in nearby streets Concierge staff helpful in tracking down an international courier parcel Grandiose decor inside

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Old Edwardian charm and location The dining room and other public spaces were done by the interior designer of the RMS TITANIC and the dining room is an almost exact copy

Negative:  Air conditioning unit didn t work and it was a hot night on Saturday with quite thick duvets on the bed Also the bathroom was VERY compact Quite a tight squeeze to get to the sink and mirror  |Positive:  The staff were lovely and helpful and the reception area looked impressive on arrival Throughout the hotel the decor classy The room was lovely and quiet and the bed was extremely comfortable Good location with easy reach to train station tube and restaurants 
Negative:  I m not usually one to complain but the bathroom towel rail was permanently on and extremely hot The sink in the bathroom was very small Being on the first floor was extremely noisy in the morning and I was awakened early It was very hot in London this weekend and the air conditioning was broken making the room uncomfortable at times I was also unhappy that I d left some change out on the side in the bathroom and when I returned on Sunday evening that money had disappeared I know this is a small thing and it wasn t a great amount of money but it still should not have been taken Another gripe was that a wine glass from the night before was not taken away the next day either  |Positive:  The Staff were excellent the Bloody Mary s in the bar were perfect and the location was ideal 
Negative:  I wonder why we could not choose the table when we had a breakfast Is it separated by race or rank of room we are Japanese I hope not This is the first hotel which the staves designated our table And the tables we were shown were not so comfortable Besides I would like to request to improve the breakfast And about our room honestly I regreted not asking to change another room I wanted have stayed my mother at the room which is better lighted and better view even if I paid extra fee because it was my mother s last 3 days of staying in London  |Positive:  Some of staves talked to us in Japanese so we felt welcome

Negative:  The biggest issue for me and my group with this hotel is the fact the staff do not appear to have a good command of English and this was hugely frustrating Not only did we stay but we had a huge meeting there with them too It was starting to drive us insane them not understanding simple instructions from us forgetting refreshments etc there is a lack of attention to detail at this hotel too and I do think the language barrier plays a big part in this For this reason alone I sadly will not be coming back  |Positive:  Location is great and nice and central Stayed in single rooms and they were okay comfortable and quiet Bar was nice and cocktails were lovely

Negative:  My husband was accused of smoking in room he hadnt thy put a letter under our door and took 200 out of my account without permission 4 conversations later they reumbersed monies but it ruined it for me as i was very upset about it They made us feel like criminals and didnt give us a chance to defend ourselves our friend who we met whilst in London is a barrister and was appalled when we told him  |Positive:  Liked the room very cosy comfy bed

Negative:  During my last 2 days the WiFi connection became very weak and spotty Staff said it was being worked on but I sensed that a fast resolution wasn t high enough priority  |Positive:  Despite being a gorgeous hotel with unique history Hotel Russell remains surprisingly affordable and feels like any luxury hotel should The staff are as helpful and well trained as they are friendly and personable I also appreciated the restaurant and beautiful bar which offered a more well rounded experience vs just a rented room I look forward to coming back throughout the years to come

Negative:  Location was not very entertaining from tourist point of view I had a room with inside view so felt very suffocated  |Positive:  Classic architecture preserved nicely

Negative:  Nothing not to like at a 120pn price point |Positive:  Well maintained Victorian splendour Great bar and breakfast room Wide carpeted corridors Large room with requested walk in shower
Negative:  The only reason i booked with hotel Russell was because of the bath advertised to be in my room but when i got there it looked nothing like in the picture it was dirty and had badly chipped enamel there weren t any complementary items worth mentioning just a small amount of cheap shampoo and the room took ages to heat up  |Positive:  I like the decor
Negative:  the chaise lounge in the room needs some attention looks a bit shabby  |Positive:  we got upgraded to the junior suite heating had broken in there however they had already put two heaters in so we didn t need to ask the reception bar staff and porter were very friendly and accommodating

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This is a wonderful old hotel in a great location Easy access to underground but also with walking distant to most attractions Serge and Bernard made our stay at the Russell very special From the moment we arrived to our departure 3 days later they went out of their way to make our stay at the Russell memorable

Negative:  The room was drafty but it s an old building and the room was on the corner I expected it and it wasn t much of an issue  |Positive:  The staff member who checked us in was fantastic his name was Miles and he was so lovely helped us enormously and scored us some cake for the room A winner in my book Even free glasses of wine as our room was not ready at the stated time 
Negative:  Rooms are too small there is no water or mini bar available at rooms Small water is offered within the price almost given every hotel including 3 stars rooms are too cold and the heating system of the room is not sufficient to heat the room  |Positive:  Location of the Hotel is very good very close to public transportation
Negative:  No notice given fire alarm tested no staff on floors to say there was not a fire Rooms not cleaned until very late in the day |Positive:  Breakfast good staff in dining room good

Negative:  Maid didn t make the room two days |Positive:  It is a begging xx century building with very comfortable and warm rooms The building was conceived by the same architect of the Titanic elegant restaurant 
Negative:  Very very poor sleep during stay  |Positive:  Not much A very very loud heating system which banged as though some one was hitting the door every 15 minutes throughout the night Requested a room change for the next one to be even lower like a turbo engine starting directly over the top of the bed Also given the wrong room number on arrival 
Negative:  Odd that a posh hotel was pushing adult channels in the rooms Don t people have the internet The dinning room was great but the plastic tables and supermarket breakfast was a let down Staff were not the same standard as the hotel the bar was dirty and always had to get up to ask for things despite there being 3 people behind the bar chatting to each other All in all a great hotel but not well run  |Positive:  Amazing exterior
Negative:  We felt that the bathroom was missing several items that you would expect to find in such a hotel I e Toilet brush shower cap cotton wool face cloths The room had a very narrow window looking out over a boiler or something similar This was supposed to be a superior room but that was hard to believe  |Positive:  Staff were very helpful and nice to deal with 
Negative:  Windows need cleaning Shower slow to drain and sink faucet leaks need fixing The only real complaint is that the doors of other rooms closing along with the fire doors at night are fairly noisy and could keep a light sleeper up  |Positive:  Overall great price for central London Some minor issues with the shower sink but very minor really Not impeccably clean but not what I d call dirty either Windows could use a cleaning Room is small but plenty big for just me and again great price for central London Staff was friendly and having the hotel bar open until 1a is great considering every other pub closes at 11p or midnight Plenty of food options and pubs nearby and the Picadilly line is one block away I stayed here 12 nights on business vacation and would definitely stay again for the price I paid 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Beautiful building external and internal which makes you feel like you are staying somewhere special Very handy for the theatre which was the reason for our trip 
Negative:  The air conditioning in are room didn t work so well so it got really warm didn t feel the need to complain as we loved staying a spa would of been nice in the hotel also |Positive:  The hotel was beautiful in setting just what we were looking for
Negative:  The hotel ventilation units were just outside the window working 24 7 you can not imagine the noise check the photos No refrigerator Room was rather small |Positive:  Close to the center Living in a hotel of your dreams like a fairy tail the personnel was extremely polite and helpful
Negative:  This property is listed as accessible My daughter uses a manual wheelchair but is able to stand for very short periods THIS FACILITY IS ONLY ACCESSIBLE IF THEY SET UP A MOTORIZED DEVICE much like a stairway system installed in one s home Can you imagine the trouble it would be to have that device set up each time you came and went The embarrassment and time wasted cannot be estimated I ended up carrying my daughter s chair there was not always a doorman present up the 5 6 steps while my daughter hauled herself up and down using the railing This facility is not accessible unless you come and go once a day with scheduled times In fact when we first arrived a bellman told us there was not a way to get into the hotel w a wheelchair The staff requires education Later that evening the manager called and apologized for staff being unaware of the electric system Please change your listing to not accessible The table floor lamp was tipsy when we wrote on the surface it would almost tip over The bathroom appeared clean but the shower curtain smelled mildewed  |Positive:  The concierge Max and doorman Serge were extremely helpful in our navigating the city The location is very central facing Russell Square very close to the British Museum and 15 20 walk to Piccadilly Circus Russell Square is very nicely landscaped 
Negative:  Tiny room for 200 while listening to people stamping around above and paper walls next door Had enter and leave the room very awkwardly just to get in and out due to no space Ridiculous price and nothing like what is shown in the pictures on booking Beware  |Positive:  Good location in central London close to several tube stops 
Negative:  Lack of toilet facilities on the ground floor Opposite end of the hotel to the restaurant and bar which when you have mobility issues can be a long trek  |Positive:  Atmosphere staff overall facilities location 
Negative:  The hotel was undergoing a refurbishment and needs it in a lot of areas We were offered a choice of rooms including a quiet room This turned out to be a pokey double bedroom at the front of the hotel facing onto the square with single glazed windows Noisy all night bath did not drain and bathroom was pokey small Was changed to a better room on second night which was much better but beware of hit and miss and make sure to ask for a quality room  |Positive:  The location was great and the sense of place and old world was good however 
Negative:  I generally do not eat breakfast in the hotel partly because Carluccio s is close at hand and I am more interested in Italian cuisine than a more conservative English hotel cuisine I hesitate to say that I am unhappy with the dining room or the bar because the hotel is so wonderful in other respects Nevertheless these might be the only parts of the Russell that would benefit from change That being said however few hotels manage change successfully and I would hate to see the Russell lose its undoubted charm  |Positive:  The Russell is one of my favourite hotels in London perhaps my favourite The architecture and the decoration of the ground floor in particular is interesting as well as charming the view over Russell Square is lovely the staff especially the concierges are very helpful and the proximity of the hotel to the British Library extremely convenient 
Negative:  The bed was itself very uncomfortable and very noisy which really spoil tour trip The pillows were well used and lumpy The breakfast was not the best coffee and tea were not great tasting some breakfast items were Luke warm and queuing up to make toast  |Positive:  The offer I booked was good value the wine and chocolates were a nice element the hotel was in a good position and the hotel was clean and well laid out The staff were all friendly and helpful A good selection at breakfast but some elements were poor quality
Negative:  Found the room far to hot comparable to when I slept in Egypt but that s probably personal to me Would of liked a room with a view but what do you expect when paying less than normal price and you are only sleeping  |Positive:  Location was great for tube and walking into the heart of action
Negative:  Bedroom was small but to be expected staying in a double room in London if you wanted something spacious maybe upgrade to a delux we didn t and regretted it But overall enjoyable hotel would defiantly return |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The room we had was v small for the amount we paid 135 for one night You could only just walk around the bed and there was hardly any space to store clothes |Positive:  Good location and beautiful building and the bed was comfy Easy walk to theatres shops and sites
Negative:  no mini bar in the room and the temperature controls didn t function properly Small tv screen  |Positive:  the atmosphere and the architecture of the building Comfortable room Nice bathroom with a great shower 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The staff particularly the porters were very friendly and more than happy to talk to you and make you feel welcome Serge provided us with a detailed history of the building and local area 
Negative:  Our room was very substandard for a deluxe double with cracks on the bathroom floor a leaking sing no mirror with the vanity table the bed was not completed with cushions and throws and the overall ambiance of the room was awful  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Staff not as professional as I remember Layout of the reception Entrance Hall does not reflect the grandeur of the hotel  |Positive:  Proximity to St Pancras Kings Cross Tube stations Comfortable rooms and good hotel

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The staff were extremely friendly and attentive The interior it historic and stunning The bar is cosy and yet sophisticated a good place to drink and relax in even if traveling on your own

Negative:  Room was tired looking very small and Windows had so much condensation damp I had to use a towel to dry it off Not good for my asthma |Positive:  the staff were really all very helpful professional and lovely Location was superb for us
Negative:  I didn t like the breakfast for the price it cost I ve stayed at other 4 Star hotels with much more variety The bed creaked and in order to open the door with the card I had to make several attempts  |Positive:  I liked the fact that the hotel was a lovely old building with a grand reception area and decor The staff were friendly and the rooms spacious and clean The hotel was within walking distance from the British Museum Covent Garden Soho I also liked the fact that it is practically next to Russell Square underground station and Holborn statio is very close 
Negative:  We have stayed here many times and will again but we were this time under a very creaky floor room 625 so were disturbed by noise several times which has never happened before Will maybe avoid this room next time  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The lifts are very small Breakfast has no fresh salad such as sliced tomatoes cucumbers I would also add some more selection of cheese and sausages |Positive:  The location is excellent the stuff is friendly and overall the service was very good The room is clean and comfortable
Negative:  The first room they gave us smelt of cigarettes Then we were put in a tiny room sink was blocked shower didn t work properly also the television didn t work very well  |Positive:  Good location Staff were friendly
Negative:  Would have expected a touch more luxury in the rooms for the price Shower hard to control and poor flow mouldy silicone sealant cracked tiles Not really worth the extra money back to premier inn in future  |Positive:  Beautiful hotel fantastic staff kind helpful friendly knowledgable Great breakfast selection Beautiful common areas Perfect location for our needs 
Negative:  The room we were offered standard double was nothing like that advertised paid for superior double No bath no view in fact no window I can only describe the room as a converted broom cupboard I am very dissapoibted with both the hotel AND your booking system which is extremely misleading at least when marketing this hotel  |Positive:  Not a lot
Negative:  Breakfast was too expensive so went elsewhere could hear a low generator humming throughout the night |Positive:  Loved the location very grand old style hotel everything was perfect lovely room and bathroom Staff very friendly 
Negative:  Bathroom facilities very small and cramped not really suitable for my pregnant wife so larger people would have been very uncomfortable Room a little dated and check in was slow Due to roads being closed around Bloomsbury square car park the hotels suggestion and discounted offer the car park was only accessible by one road which neither the hotel staff or police could direct to 45 mins later we found it Was only a short walk so could be better on other days  |Positive:  Great location friendly Tempus bar beautiful building and opposite park and the history such as George the Dragon Good quality breakfast as always with PH just missing touches such as tea pots tea cups and fruit coulis etc
Negative:  The bathroom was that small you couldn t reach the sink unless you were stood sideways If the radiator had been on it would have been very uncomfortable |Positive:  Good location 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Quiet room although so central Possibility of a single room Water hot and plentiful Bed comfortable Hotel clean Breakfast lovely Newspapers provided 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Opulent surroundings and friendly helpful staff The Tempus Bar brings added luxury with its leather wood paneling and wide selection of drinks Great location for Soho and Covent Garden We loved every minute of our stay We will definitely return 
Negative:  I have never seen a worse bed in any hotel I ve stayed in anywhere in the world Was well past its best and staff knew it as they instantly refunded my payment  |Positive:  Staff dealt with my complaint very well
Negative:  tray of used crockery etc outside my door when checking in to my room Still there several hours later thermostat limited on very cold night Not warm enough  |Positive:  handy location nice hotel 
Negative:  however the rooms were not maintaned so well as the common parts of the hotel TV handler did not work wifi did not work phone in the room did not work Concierge was nice and came into my room to repair but definetly rooms are overpriced they are old and need a strong refurbishment  |Positive:  the architecture the lobby breakfast room and bar Very class and Brittish old style 
Negative:  The buffet breakfast was the single worst hot buffet I ve ever had Plates were dirty with dried on food and when told about this the guy behind the buffet just gave me another plate also dirty with no apology Sausages only cooked on one side congealed beans hash browns literally dripping grease Such a shame as the dining room could be an asset to an otherwise decent and historic hotel  |Positive:  Room was small but comfortable clean and good value for money Reception staff were good other staff seemed fairly disengaged Hotel is historic and architecturally interesting 
Negative:  Decor is extremely tired and dated Wallpaper peeling off walls windows did not open mould around window edges and in shower grouting antiquated bathroom and a standalone heater in the bedroom Dust around edges of carpet I m not sure how this is acceptable in a central London hotel which costs upwards of 110 per night Definitely will not be recommending this hotel to friends or re visiting myself although I can t praise the staff enough  |Positive:  Concierge and reception staff were outstanding Friendly helpful the best customer service I have come across Truly the saving grace of this hotel Called reception from our room and one of the staff arrived at our door within 3 minutes and was very polite and cheerful Particular thanks to Carey on concierge who was exceptionally helpful 
Negative:  There was nothing that we didn t like  |Positive:  The hotel was beautiful It was very clean It was ideal in location The staff very friendly very helpful 
Negative:  Had a bad experience with room service 45 minutes we waited until we called to chase up then we were told it would be another 15 minutes Clearly they didn t make note of our order from our first call We also paid for late check out until 2pm but were disturbed 3 times by housekeeping obvious lack of communication  |Positive:  Great location spacious room Room was ready early so we could check in at 12 30

Negative:  Bar and lounge area were very dark so made it difficult to read books or magazines or any literature that we wanted to review for a next days adventures |Positive:  Friendly staff great location good sized room with a comfortable bed
Negative:  The breakfast experience is like something out of BHS They need to make it a little more like an quality hotel experience Also the bar is a disaster they don t know whether they are running a pub type facility ie bar service or a lounge facility ie waiter service I won t go in again  |Positive:  Location and price
Negative:  Nothing  |Positive:  Outstanding customer service comfort in the rooms and the public areas of the Hotel and just that feeling of being made to feel welcome every day 
Negative:  My room wasn t very clean Dirt chunks coming out of heater onto desk When I mentioned that at front desk they just smiled at me White spots on extra blanket So I didn t want to use it Although I love the location and this is my 2nd stay it will probably be my last  |Positive:  Love location Hysterical value of building Breakfast was good but I don t understand why a 5 charge for a tray when your already being charged room service fees 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We stayed here the first time and had a great experience great room the room service order got screwed up but we weren t to bothered Awesome location We liked it so much we came back a few days later and it was terrible I think we must have been upgraded to a nicer room the first time without being told so the second time when they offered us an upgraded room we declined thinking it would be the same as before It sure wasn t The room stunk had a bank of about 20 aircon units outside the window the air con in the room didn t work so we had to have the windows open in the middle of winter to keen it cool The bathroom was filthy and the bed extremely uncomfortable and squeaky Would never stay in this rooms again but the upgraded rooms are really good They also screwed up our room service order the second time and the operator didn t know what a hashbrown was even though it was on the menu 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The hotel was beautiful Very elegant All the staff were very friendly and helpful especially Bernard the Concierge The location was great with much to see and do within walking distance We would definitely stay there again 
Negative:  There was a large cobweb in the corner above the TV room 225 The bar area was difficult to find a seat so I had to resort to staying in my room when I just needed to sit down rest and have a well deserved beer  |Positive:  The staff really looked after the customers in a very polite and professional manner 
Negative:  Had to wait for a second room as first one did not offer a bath as requested Freezing room until radiators kicked in Tired carpet Poor insulated windows |Positive:  Central location Beautiful Victorian features Very comfortable bed Very serene view
Negative:  Auto service charge Paying extra for breakfast Good food but no better than other UK 3 4 star I ve stayed in No soundproofing  |Positive:  Comfy room with reasonable extras Needed a shower cap tho as shower didn t lower control was on bath tap 
Negative:  The bar prices are astronomically high so we left the hotel and spent the evenings elsewhere  |Positive:  Very reasonable rate spotlessly clean standard room Very good breakfast with smiling helpful and polite staff Nice bar area 
Negative:  We booked a superior then upgraded to a junior suite we found a mouse in the room and it was handled terribly They moved us to a smaller room with a bad view and it was 2 single beds pushed together They gave us the 60 it cost to upgrade back and offered us complimentary breakfast but after seeing a mouse in our room there was no way we were going to eat there They then offered champagne which when it came to the room was not champagne at all it was sparkling wine For the amount we paid to find a mouse in the room and for the staff to not even care it s fair to say we will never be staying there again  |Positive:  The location 
Negative:  My room had the old style windows and so the draft and noise from the main road was slightly inconvenient but did not detract from my experience  |Positive:  Really really friendly efficient staff I went for the single room option and was pleasantly surprised how nice it was was clean and with a spacious bathroom Very comfortable stay a I m glad I booked it Convent Garden is only a 15 min walk away and Russell Square Tube station is just outside the hotel so very convenient 
Negative:  Not very clean and rooms not really looked after lots of little things were very worn dirty or broken in the bathroom and room  |Positive:  Location and style and history of the building 
Negative:  Breakfast pricing of 19 for 2 ppl was not included in our stay deal Seemed a tad disproportionate and unfair but perhaps London thinks it can justify that price for egg bacon a sausage toast and tea we had breakfast at Giraffe Cafe 2 minutes away very nice  |Positive:  The bed was amazingly comfy and huge The hotel was clean and a work of art Amazing and beautiful building Staff extremely friendly and courteous Very well informed and helpful Loved all the retro art deco features rooms tastefully done Would definitely stay again great location 
Negative:  We got a room that was very small and not very fresh The pictures on the hotels website for std dbl room was not what we got We could change room though  |Positive:  Very helpful and nice staff Tube directley from Heathrow to the hotel 
Negative:  We had booked a superior double room but were given a twin with sofa bed when we asked about this we were told there were no double rooms we could have but to compensate were given free breakfast Our room was on the second floor and the night we stayed there was a wedding reception in the ground floor reception room directly below us which meant putting up with loud music well after midnight I was surprised not to have a mini bar in the room and there were no hangers to hang long articles of clothing presumably the height of the hanging rail was intended for wheel chair users I also found I kept banging my elbow on the handrail in the shower over the bath again an adaptation for disabled guests The shower head could not be angled to anything other than straight down which meant standing awkwardly so as not to get my hair wet no shower cap provided and it also did not stay at the height I required and needed constant raising We went for breakfast at probably the most popular time and had to wait for a table even though there were tables for two empty and next to each other which could have been pushed together to accommodate the three of us couples were taken from the queue behind us and seated whilst we had to wait for a larger table to empty when a table of six left theirs was seperated to make a four and a two So why couldn t two tables be pushed together for us earlier  |Positive:  Location of hotel for our trip was good the hotel is impressive and the staff were friendly The beds were comfortable and clean 
Negative:  Staff at the reception didn t give us 2 sets of cards The lights went in one of the rooms and no one told me that my son was moved to another room  |Positive:  Location was great and the room was very spacious 
Negative:  No leisure gym facilities  |Positive:  Easy access to the West end on foot Friendly professional staff The building is beautiful with art deco features rooms of a good size 
Negative:  The decor while nice is a little tired e g fabric on chair is torn woodwork chipped This was only a small point but is a bit out of step with the grand exterior and reception area of the hotel  |Positive:  The style of the hotel was quite grand and the Christmas decorations were lovely and festive The location was perfect for my needs and there are lots of shops and cafes very nearby for e g breakfast or lunch with pubs and restaurants close too or very short walk away for even more choice I was in a single room that was well suited size wise The layout of the room is well considered and the most is made of the space

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Were staying in london for just one night and the location was perfect we paid around 200 for one night for a family suite and it was very well worth the money

Negative:  Housekeeping is not attentive not caring at all Once when I returned to my room at night there is not even a piece of towels in the toilet Also they won t give you enough set of towels Even if they give you they just left a pile for you to sort They never refill your toiletries needs u have to ask specifically everyday The most essential things when you finished they won t refill it for you But only replenish those you already left in full bottles but with even more that is not what you need E g I have 4 full bottles of conditioners 3 full bottles of shampoo but none for bath gel body cream They don t provide you with basic needs like slippers Cotton pads wools Q tips But we saw it in their trolley Not even refill teabags milk sugar Rooms are considered not clean to normal hotel standard  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  expensive breakfast especially when you only want a coffee and croissant We went to Starbucks around the corner for this  |Positive:  location to city attractions The room was comfortable and quiet Bathroom was clean and the hot water in the shower was plentiful 
Negative:  the traffic near the hotel was madness but that was likely due to the construction going on nearby once that is off the traffic will be better  |Positive:  the location is the perks here it is walking distance to the london eye and everything near it it is also about a 10 minute walk away from the nearest tube station there are many little cafes nearby so overall it is really convenient

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Convenience location 10 mins walk to Waterloo tube station 3 mins to London eye Suggest to choose a room with outside view finally paid 20 per night to upgrade 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  LOCATION perfect STAFF we went into the wrong hotel initially thinking that the Park Plaza Building at the westminster bridge is the same as the county hall hotel It wasn t The staff at the Park Plaza Westminster hotel were all very warm and welcoming Their hospitality felt genuine right from the guy who greeted us at the main entrance all the way up to the lady at the reception who gave us directions going to the Park Plaza county hall hotel which was the adjacent building at the back They were all smiley and happy to assist us On the other hand the staff at the county hotel were polite and did their job alright The lady at the reception gave us a voucher for two complimentary drinks at the bar while we waited and they checked if the room was the ready It was a quick 10min wait which was fine No greeting nor smile at all from the bartender and the waiter at the Spectrum Bar It was 1500H and the bar was definitely not busy The difference between our experience between the staff from both Park Plaza Hotels was just really evident that I had to put it here ROOM SUPERIOR Room We stayed for our anniversary We got a complimentary full bottle of wine greeting card and they decorated our room with petals and swan folded towels We were also assigned to a corner room with a view of the big ben and london eye which was very beautiful at night The TV monitor in the room serves like a multimedia browser where you can view your current room bill do self check out watch youtube videos listen to the radio etc The bedroom and bath were just the right size It was not small but not too big as well We didn t have a lot of luggage with us so it was just right Mini bar was stocked with the basics We liked that there were extra pillows for us to use Bed was comfortable to sleep on but was really really squeaky and we re not big people at all if you know what i mean BREAKFAST good old continental and english breakfast

Negative:  The room was very much smaller than I anticipated It must have been smaller than it should have been because the receptionist informed me that it was very small as I checked in I had expected to have a small living area and that was why I booked this particular hotel as I did not want a traditional hotel room I did not get that  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  We had a leaky kettle they were light on with milk coffee in the room |Positive:  I liked that there were crockery cutlery a microwave in the room
Negative:  Apparently the hotel guests before us had replaced 2 of the minibar drinks with their own and as a result we were charged for the 2 drinks Not many cafes and food option nearby |Positive:  The location is fantastic about 10 minutes walk to the Waterloo Station and London Eye The Studio Double room is made up of 2 smaller rooms interconnected by a mini kitchenette There are kitchenware and microwave for use One room consist of a queen size bed and a sofa bed in the other Suitable for family of 4 There is a public laundry room for those who would like their laundry to be done

Negative:  Very poor room cleanliness very disorganised housekeeping no towels in room on second day had to ask twice to get it resolved |Positive:  Friendly staff good location
Negative:  The bathroom needs update the layout is awkward and the faucet is old Also the bathtub door is half way there is no way to avoid water on the floor while taking a shower Secondly the beds are not comfortable enough The hotel can do a little bit considering the rate charged on each room Lastly the air freshener used by housekeeping after daily cleaning smells terrible please change it  |Positive:  The hotel location is great It is a walking distance to London eye westiminster bridge parliament square Westminster Abbey Buckingham palace and many more The staffs are great and very responsive to request

Negative:  Seemed slightly shambolic I checked in around 7pm and yet I was told I wouldn t have towels until an hour later although when I actually went to the room the towels were there but the bathroom just seemed a little ehhh I kept finding stray hairs around the place that didn t belong to me Bit gross  |Positive:  The location is good 
Negative:  Milk in the room fridge Off Breakfast staff 3 days out of the 6 I had to ask for coffee No one checked me All other people couples were asked Perhaps a singles thing Otherwise all good Staff friendly and helpful Location brill  |Positive:  Friendly staff Location 
Negative:  Since we booked studio room with 2 children the hotel did not provide extra sleeping pillows and blanket for the extra bed in the room  |Positive:  Very good breakfast and nice staff for service We would love to stay here again if there any chance
Negative:  The only thing that mark the hotel down on was the room didn t have a window that opened Not a problem with the aircon on but I like fresh air when I sleep The bed was a little uncomfortable but no bed is ever the same as your own The shower head leaked and made the floor wet but that wasn t an inconvenience to me more of a pain for the housekeeping I guess  |Positive:  The staff were kind polite very helpful and you could have a joke with them too We received a room upgrade upon check in The room was fabulous The hotel was clean and well presented We loved it and would definitely stay again and recommend to others 
Negative:  The view from our room  |Positive:  Breakfast was awesome Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful The Bar Restaurant was very convenient and provided great service Loved the food and drinks they had to offer The bedroom and shower was nice I enjoyed my stay and would definitely book a room at Park Plaza County Hall next time I m in town In terms of location you can t beat it all the landmarks are within walking distance and Waterloo station is just around the corner so you can get around town on the tube very easily 
Negative:  The location was disappointing due to all the construction in the area which I was unaware of and which spoilt the view from my room I found the area very congested and noisy so would probably not use the hotel again I realize however that this is a personal preference and other guests may enjoy the area  |Positive:  The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was clean and comfortable 
Negative:  The reception staff were really unhelpful and glum They never smiled Almost any request was too much trouble In a hotel that has no swimming pool or public rooms the reception staff are key These appear to have been poorly selected trained and not proactively managed A poor reflection of the brand and hotel  |Positive:  Great location and helpful porters and concierge staff 
Negative:  I discussed my grievance with the duty manager who promised me she would address them upon checkout Upon checkout I was told she was busy however she would email me with her findings As of now now communication have been made  |Positive:  NOTHING
Negative:  Room had a few damaged bits here and there Very clean though the bed was big but I found it as firm as the sofa bed in our room Air con seemed to be low in the day and fast and very cold in the early hours The other main issue was the lifts In busy times we waited 15 minutes as we had a baby buggy with us I had 1 gripe as I m quite OCD and don t like reusing towels i didn t receive the extra towels I ordered from housekeeping twice once each day  |Positive:  Breakfast that was available no veggie full breakfast was very good with nice pastries Staff were nice and sociable throughout the hotel 
Negative:  Small for a family of 4 A little over priced for what you get however expected for that time of year Not enough pillows House keeping knocked at our door fairly early which was disappointing as we just flew for 24hours  |Positive:  Location of the property
Negative:  Air conditioning was a problem We had to let them know twice before it was handled Overall we very much loved our stay  |Positive:  upgraded our room went out of their way to quickly check us in The restaurant was a pleasant surprise very good food and service 
Negative:  Booked a double room but had two single beds pushed together with two single duvets being with my partner we weren t happy as we had to sleep separated due to this Also there is not enough milk coffee and sugar left in the room |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Booking com has wrong room advertised for Penthouse suite actual room very disappointing Who is to Blame here Staff at reception not helpful about mix up House keeping is very average and be prepared for very long wait for breakfast in the mornings hotel is more concerned about money than the customer 1st photo is what you are shown of room at time of booking next photos actual room After spending over 800 pounds for 2 nights not happy Hotel says there is nothing they can do about what images are shown of rooms yet all there images are copyrighted as per there website has been happening a long time but I believe they are happy for it to keep happening as when you have booked and arrived it s too late money is paid what you going to do attitude  |Positive:  Location was great to be honest but after that it s all down hill 
Negative:  The breakfast was not how I expected it Also the breakfast staff on the restaurant was not as welcoming  |Positive:  Welcoming staff on the front desk Very helpeful Amazing location and view from bedroom 
Negative:  I called the hotel to ask if I can pay the last night of our family stay by Maestro debit card and the hotel staff confirmed this is possible When we checked out appeared it is not possible not a huge problem but staff are giving incorrect information  |Positive:  Great central location 5 min walk from London eye Big Ben Waterloo station Very clean hotel and great service 
Negative:  There is nothing significant to dislike As a way to improve they should provide the following two things especially for families with little kids liquid handwash in the bathroom bottled drinking water because the tap water may not be suitable for young children most hotels around the world in this price range do not charge for water for kids  |Positive:  The kitchenette in the room is just the thing a family needs The view of London Eye is great The staff is quite responsive to all needs This includes everyone from front desk restaurant housekeeping and concierge They were very courteous and helpful to us The breakfast is very good too A lot of variety The hotel location is the best part Very close to the Waterloo station A number of trains to places outside of London originate terminate here Couple of bus stops are also nearby Westminster bridge London Eye and other tourist attractions on the river bank are just a short walk The county hall area has a few decent restaurants a starbucks and a convenience store The booking com offer of free entry tickets to various attractions saved us a lot of money It is a very good offer 
Negative:  Breakfast was a little busy Hit the peak you would wait but the staff laid out juice coffee for anyone in a queue Breakfast quality itself was excellent |Positive:  Little extras made a big difference It was a hot day when we arrived to our room yet the staff had left a keycard in the slot so the air on continued to run had closed the curtains so the room was comfortable There were drinks not the normal water but fruit juices which the kids loved We were a towel short 1 evening 1 phone call to reception towels appeared at the door within 5 minutes The location is superb 5 minutes walk from Waterloo train station so easy access a stone throw from the London Eye the South Bank a bridge walk to either Westminster or Soho We were on the 13th floor we could have been in the country It was quiet no road or plane noise at all 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Loved the location close to two subway stations big rooms with microwave gym and sauna Aurora spa services also great Liked the good security on entering the property Would go back again Especially with families

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Breakfast was just okay Family suite was perfect Pretty quiet even at night Close to all major London attractions except Greenwich Shakespeare s globe but we walked there just fine 
Negative:  There was not much options for the vegetarians in breakfast  |Positive:  Great Stay Superb Location Comfy Beds Good English Breakfast Friendly Staff front desk 
Negative:  Cleaners woke up us too early in the morning breakfast wasn t worth the money and the food hall was too small so we had to wait in line for quite a while bathroom was awkwardly placed in between beds and room wasn t big enough for two people to walk around at once and there was no bin  |Positive:  Location was helpful cleanliness was average reception was nice 
Negative:  I was disappointed I emailed and went to no end of trouble to explain what we wanted Everyone was confused However we were told in the end we could upgrade for another 100 00 pound a night which annoyed me We did this as the room we had was dark and too small there was always confusion about things The two tvs were so quiet we couldnt hear them so every time we turned them on we had to call the maintenance man to turn them up which was so annoying In the end they left us with their remote so we didnt have to do it Concierge was very good but depended who was on Breakfast was ok but really really busy Overrall I wouldnt stay again as I would rather be in the middle of the town We had to take a taxi to Oxford St all the time  |Positive:  The bed was a good size and the sofa bed was good Good with nespresso machine and microwave We ended up with good big windows and a light room 
Negative:  Nothing not a thing my son and I loved it  |Positive:  Staff were exceptional I wish there were a higher rating Friendly and chatty while still being highly efficient and making sure our stay was perfect This hotel is an ideal spot for a trip to London we could walk a large majority of places we wanted to go but still very quiet and restful The kitchenette is a lively touch we didn t cook but it apenabled us to store snacks cereal etc And milk and water on the fridge Plenty of wardrobe and storage space Bathroom shower in particular was excellent Breakfast each morning was great and though there are a large number of peopl 14 floors highly organised and efficient Wifi was great easily able to stream Netflix etc And there was a big screen TV with many apps and all the premium channels 
Negative:  The digging outside the Reseption But of course this will be finished  |Positive:  I have been several times in London This is my best hotel stay Close to everything 
Negative:  They need to provide slippers The fridge needs to be bigger To give you an idea of its size it could only fit two 1 5 liter soda bottles  |Positive:  The location can t be beaten The separation between the two beds allows parents to hang out in one side of the room while the kids sleep in peace on the other side 
Negative:  Could have been more child friendly There were kids in the group that were 4 and six No facilities for children to play or be entertained  |Positive:  Staff at breakfast were very good Concierge staff security staff were excellent very helpful Good breakfast for the money 
Negative:  Small and very dark room  |Positive:  Room was comfortable but very small More intimate than private but clean and tidy Shower difficult to use and poor screen means it leaks on the bathroom floor Compact sink but all in all everything you need and hotel affords a great location 
Negative:  Sofa bed was terrible did not sleep whatsoever on the first night The bars were poking through the very thin mattress The amount of money paid for the accommodation I was expecting at least a comfortable bed Everything else was terrific The location and cleanliness A1  |Positive:  Proximity excellent
Negative:  Our first room was not to our liking We paid a reasonable amount for and upgrade the following day and we were much happier  |Positive:  We were greeted so warmly and treated like old friends by the chef upon our late arrival to the restaurant the first night He was an outstanding ambassador for the hotel and made us feel very welcome and special 
Negative:  Booked the hotel room one month prior to the check in date to get the the best price possible However I found out that the room rate went down considerably before my stay More than 350 GPB for 8 nights Communicating with the hotel management they did not agree to lower the price Booking com made a wonderful gesture keeping its promise of best price guarantee Booking com refunded me 352 GBP the difference in the price Thank you Booking com for keeping the promise  |Positive:  I like the Location that is close to London Eye Big Ben and the Themes I like the nice room size 
Negative:  I did not like the bathtub with the shower The shower was difficult to use without getting water everywhere and the bathtub was difficult to get in and out of  |Positive:  The staff was extra helpful and friendly The breakfast was good and the chef made sure we got what we wanted I also like that the hotel was close to where we wanted to be 
Negative:  Restaurant is dual purpose Good menu in the evening and very professionally run by the staff Breakfast very ordinary I am afraid Food from the cooked options cold Toaster both of them are not user friendly especially when there are children using them Tried the option of ordering breakfast next day as per the options Eggs Benedictine were excellent as was the restaurant service  |Positive:  Complimentary upgrade to suite well received Room absolutely perfect especially after long working day Location is great for South Bank and County Hall exhibitions and conferences 
Negative:  The sound proofing of the room is terrible and you could here everything outside the door and in other room The layout of the room is very strange with the bed just beside the door and living room at the end of the room The location of the hotel is ok it looks very close to the underground but actually need to walk 10min from the station Not impressed with the service of the staff either  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  They purposely not allowed my parents to check in one hour earlier since the room was ready The reason I wanted to check in earlier because my parents took a 15hours flight and need to take a rest before going out but the lady said the hotel policy stated check in time is at 3pm but before that she kept on allowing other customer non asian customer to check in I FELT DISCRIMINATED  |Positive: No Positive
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The room was lovely Small by American standards but to be expected in Europe The beds were very comfy and the room has a coffee and refrigeration station Plenty of storage for your clothing and bags Perfect room for 2 people Lovely hotel Would stay here again Location is superb 
Negative:  It was a bank holiday so breakfast was not served at 6 30 AM as expected We had to wait until 7 7 15 AM so a rush to get to the airport for our early morning flight  |Positive:  Doorman was very helpful obtaining a taxi for a early morning flight Helped with our luggage and opening the taxi doors for myself and my travel buddy

Negative:  Disappointed by Bar staff was ignored for ten minutes bar was quiet and staff were chatting to each other and when I finally got attention and asked for half a lager I was told rather rudely that I d need to wait until my allocated waiter was free I waited for a few more minutes I had been walking in 35 degree heat and finally gave up  |Positive:  Comfy beds and sheets huge room with fridge and microwave two tellies Very polite and helpful reception staff 
Negative:  There was a lot of construction in the area and the outside of the hotel is not picturesque but location makes up for this I would recommend asking for a room with a view I didn t even think about this when booking but was so happy with our room location on an upper floor The bathroom had a sliding glass door which lacked privacy this was not a big deal as I was traveling with my husband but might be weird if traveling with friends  |Positive:  We had a corner room on the 11th floor with two large windows Spectacular views of Big Ben Palace of Westminster the London Eye and the city skyline over the Waterloo train station This location is awesome to go to all the Southbank attractions restaurants Waterloo train underground station Westminster Bridge and longer walks along the Thames with easy access across the many bridges into the center of the city Summer night life is so much fun as the sun didn t set until after 9 30 pm and we enjoyed a glass of wine or a pitcher of Pimm s at the Southbank Centre almost every night The room was spacious especially for a hotel in London and the bed was large and comfy This is a high rise hotel so not a boutique hotel experience but the location and value for the price can t be beat The staff were super friendly and very helpful We didn t eat at the restaurant on site so can t give a review but would highly recommend this hotel 
Negative:  TV didn t work Poor lighting in room Poor toilet roll fittings No dressing gown or slippers Could have been cleaner Room had no privacy as overlooked by other rooms Also room overlooked restaurant Not up to 4 star rating Shower difficult to operate |Positive:  Nothing in particular
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This is the first time I d stayed in this hotel but it certainly won t be the last From the staff on the reception desk and the concierges to the staff in the Italian restaurant I could find no faults Everyone was very welcoming and friendly By London standards the twin bedded room was surprisingly spacious and the bed pillows so comfortable 
Negative:  Room temperature and debris falling from the air conditioning  |Positive:  The way we were checked in by Mariah giving us a good room and making our wedding anniversary so special 
Negative:  Getting woken twice up by drunken people shouting and hanging around in the corridor at 4am Not what you d expect with security about only sorted it once we called reception Bad night sleep  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The traffic was a shambles outside the hotel |Positive:  This hotel was very nice a great location near Westminster Bridge for city access The breakfast was very good A bonus was the free laundry for guests which was great after 2 weeks on the road The concierge was very friendly helpful as were the baggage guys on the front door 
Negative:  There were no actual shops nearby I like to step out on the street and have things to look at We had to taxi to the main centre of London |Positive:  We didnt like our first room It was too dark but for more money we got shifted to a bigger room with great light We had continual problems with the tv volume Everytime we turnef it on we had to call maintenance to fix the volume That was annoying The buffet breakfast was excellent but room service meal terrible They refunded our meal though 
Negative:  The room was a little hot during the night even with the air con turned right up as no windows that could open in the room |Positive:  Ideal location just a stones through from Waterloo Station Clean rooms beautiful bathroom Kettle fridge sink which was handy and iron ironing board in the room which was nice Two TV s was a nice touch so that people in both parts of the room could watch TV Comfortable bed too 
Negative:  Impersonal  |Positive:  Modern rooms close to nearly tube station and a short walk to the London Eye Great location if you want to be close to tourist hot spots but dont want to stay in a super busy area Clean and suitable rooms 
Negative:  Each day breakfast we had to ask repeatedly for a spoon for our coffee Sometimes we had to ask several times Even then sometime we never receive it Not impressive Major construction in front of the hotel It was loud with a lot of dirt and dust being thrown into the air Careful you don t get it in your eye or breath too deeply Everything else was good  |Positive:  The staff on duty in the lobby and at the front desk were GREAT 
Negative:  poor wifi all staff were nice except Ramzi at the bar who was unwelcoming and seemed to hate his job  |Positive:  Nice central location lovely view from our bedroom most staff were very welcoming and nice 
Negative:  The tv in the bedroom was inset too far into the cubby where only one person can see the tv  |Positive:  I liked the room layout because the bath room kitchen separated the room with the queen size bed and the living room which had a pull out couch that our 19 year old son stayed in 
Negative:  the images they showed for executive studio city view while booking had a great city view and when i physically saw the room there is this hotel right in front blocking the view It wasn t worth spending the money  |Positive:  The cleanliness of the whole location 
Negative:  Crowded reception and queues Room 109 room is next to something that makes noise during night which sounds like patio being opened Appalling breakfast grumpy staff queues and restaurant crammed tables too close to each other not big enough for restaurant |Positive:  Bar staff were attentive and service great
Negative:  Nothing location was excellent staff were super helpful and their Italian restaurant a had extremely good good at reasonable prices |Positive:  Extremely clean modern and updated great room set up for a family with two children The double bed is in one room and the kids have a fold out couch in the other 
Negative:  We couldn t open the curtains in the morning because of the heat The airconditioner did NOT cope Hot I don t know how you could stay there if the weather was actually hot The view from our room was Waterloo Station  |Positive:  The location was great Close to major attractions and transport We enjoyed the breakfasts We heard very little noise from Waterloo Station despite our room overlooking it 
Negative:  Noisy until 2 am Adults and children talking in the aisles slamming doors and no one from the hotel asked them to be more respectful  |Positive:  Amazing Staff Great customer service Spacious clean and comfortable room 
Negative:  Cooked breakfast option was dreadful Bacon looked like it was mechanically shredded no rashers just bits Scrambled eggs tasted disgusting Beans were only warm Stuck to the much nicer fresh option Triple room flooded as soon as shower went on Spoke to reception who said she was unable to reduce the bill  |Positive:  Plenty of selection at breakfast Attentive staff 
Negative:  Too many issues to get sorted with the room Bath plug not working no remote for the T V piece of skirting board kept falling off which had a nail sticking out had to keep asking to get tea and coffee renewed and for the sheets to be changed Staff were very helpful and kept sending people up to sort problems but for what we were paying we expected more There were also a lot of roadworks outside the hotel which meant we didn t use the hotel cafe and it took longer to walk some places  |Positive:  Comfortable bed and a good sized room Able to make hot drinks and having an ice machine in the hallway was a bonus Water and sweets were left for us on arrival Staff dealt with problems with the room quickly Could to see part of the London Eye and Big Ben from the window so we enjoyed the view Laundry room was useful when you have a longer stay 
Negative:  A bit of construction around the area |Positive:  Very close to London eye and across the bridge from Big Ben and Westminster abbey A small supermarket nearby and Starbucks Close to Waterloo station
Negative:  Room wasn t cleaned very well during my stay cups were stained and they left my PJs on the table but despite this the place was quite clean overall  |Positive:  Great room with large size flat screen TV that had you tube videos and TV Excellent staff and consierge service Would come back here again to stay 
Negative:  Although I wrote through booking com two different request and question to the hotel I never got an answer for the question and for the request only on the day of arrival The breakfast area is very small and though we were lucky and never had to wait but if you arrive around 9am be prepared to wait Some of the waiters are not always on the top of their job had to ask several times to refill eg milk and also came across a bad fruit salad once But overall nothing major and the good intention is there Last thing we were unlucky I guess our room for 3 was on the 2nd floor looking to the train station meaning bad view and WiFi was fairly weak in or room  |Positive:  Superb location starting with London Eye and Westminster Abbey Big Ben and some more within short walking distance Public transportation and train stops also very close Ideal if you don t have much time but want to get as much as possible as tourist Though in the center and recent construction next to hotel but our room was very quiet provided noise cancellation I guess Staff was very friendly and helpful highlighting Magda on reception our cleaning lady Nadia and one member I think Sarah at the breakfast 
Negative:  Would have appreciated a late check out say 3 00 pm for freshen up prior to train journey  |Positive:  Staff were friendly and very helpful Very impressed that we were afforded an upgrade which was appreciated as we had booked months in advance Buffet breakfast more than adequate and restaurant foyer in evening provided seating and food for guests wanting a smaller meal also staying in hotel Conceirage secured baggage during the day of departure while we were out 
Negative:  Not enough shower gel body lotion etc Also I had to request our complimentary water it wasn t already in the room  |Positive:  Location good value restaurant excellent staff 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The location is fantastic for exploring the south bank and walking along the river The room was on the 13th floor so had amazing views of the London Eye Comfortable bed overlooking the views of London 
Negative:  Not for business travelers I requested a quiet room but was awoken by kitchen preparation resteraunt etc every morning and evening |Positive:  Nice breakfast Good kitchen staff

Negative:  All in all a great hotel  |Positive:  Perfect location near Westminster Bridge Waterloo Mainline and tube stations and 5 minutes to South bank promenade and the London Eye Close to all sights and facilities We stayed for 8 nights in a large king sized suite with a separate large living room with view of the Shard Also had small kitchen with fridge and microwave Clean comfortable and great for an extended stay Great staff super helpful and has the bonus of a guest laundry with washers and dryers On site restaurant bars and great nearby bistros and restaurants 
Negative:  Would have preferred a room with a bath the room we were given was fine o list wanted to have a bath after walking so far  |Positive:  Overall hotel was centrally located and close to tourist attractions staff were courteous and helpful With information and very welcoming
Negative:  I liked everything  |Positive:  The view of the London Eye was amazing especially at night The bed was so comfortable with a puffy duvet and quality linens Breakfast included had a huge buffet with custom omelets 
Negative:  The hotel like many central London hotels for obvious reasons doesn t have its own car park and the excellent one right next to it that we usually use was closed due to road works and layout changes We found one online at Upper Marsh which had the advantage of booking in advance and has an attendant but it is more expensive and on getting home we found a nail in one tyre and a screw put into another and couldn t think where else it could have happened There are other parking options not too far away particularly if your vehicle doesn t need the high clearance room ours does Will ask the hotel for parking advice in advance next time or fly  |Positive:  Excellent staff who are wonderful with children light spacious rooms with good facilities Excellent central location easy walking distance of many sights two tube stations river boats and tourist buses multiple eating options Westminster Southbank and London Eye all nearby From reservations and reception to housekeeping and room service the staff couldn t have been more helpful or accommodating This is a really good hotel and great for family visits Ours was a special family visit with grandparents parents and four grandchildren two children visiting for the first time and as a birthday treat The reservation and reception teams thanks to Courtney Michaela and I think Sara apologies for any incorrect spelling helped organise rooms with a wonderful view and facilities which made the visit very special for the grandchildren and grown ups The children also enjoyed the glass lift Reception staff were absolutely wonderful Alba was so welcoming and made an instant friend when she gave our grandson a lollipop on arrival and arranged birthday balloons and chocolate cake in the room Being able to arrange breakfast in the room made for a more relaxed start to the day and room service and housekeeping were so efficient and responsive managing to get our breakfast to us when we wanted it even when we forgot to put down the time for one of the rooms making the quietest meal delivery for the babysitters when the children were asleep and restoring order to our chaotic rooms while we were out This is the second time we have stayed at Park Plaza County Hall and given the high quality of the rooms and the excellent customer service we intend to return 
Negative:  The room was a bit tired and the tea coffee facilities weren t replenished I had to ring up and ask It was delt with quickly upon the phone call |Positive:  Loved the view and the space
Negative:  Excellent location Very close to the London Eye and the Waterloo train station Unfortunately this 14 floor hotel has 3 very slow elevators Once it took me 10 minutes to reach my room at the 13th floor from the reception With the price they are charging it is simply ridiculous to have such an experience |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  House Keeping should be able to speak and understand english as when i asked for something we coudn t communicate |Positive:  The bed was very comfortable and was offered an upgrade with an awesome view of the London Eye with an early check in
Negative:  Bed a little hard and noise from the lift outside  |Positive:  Rooms were great with lots of space to put clothes away and good cupboard in bathroom Good coffee facilities and fridge to put own drink 
Negative:  Couldn t open the windows to the room to let in fresh air and the pillows were too thin which made the sleep difficult |Positive:  Staff were great and went the extra mile

Negative:  I had to make an emergency phone call to Australia and my phone wasn t charging I asked staff they said of course I didn t think to ask of cost They charged me 100 pound for a 10 minute call disgusting  |Positive:  On the whole it was excellent
Negative:  N a |Positive:  The staff so so friendly and accomodating They went above and beyond to find room in the freezer for medications and the concierge helped us on a daily basis 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  All the staff were really friendly and helpful Our family room was very spacious and comfortable with a great view Breakfast was delicious with a good choice Absolutely fabulous location for exploring London 
Negative:  Breakfast was disorganised and needed more than one chef Queued for a table and breakfast staff seemed stressed and not that helpful No toilet brush in bathroom which could prove unpleasant with people sharing especially children  |Positive:  Room size was good and kitchen facilities were a great addition for drinks etc Great view over London towards the shard and steps from the attractions on the embankment 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Location was perfect short walk from Westminster Great small restaurants and grocery shops nearby This place was a lifesaver after a dodgy previous hotel and they gave us a free upgrade 
Negative:  Bed was hard and squishy room 620 Tutorial for shower and lights would be helpful  |Positive:  Helpful staff and dining staff Clean and neat Nice breakfast Where was the real butter 
Negative:  The hotel was clean and presented very well but the bar area looked like it needed some updating the chairs and carpets were worn  |Positive:  Had a great time in London we were really close to transport if u want a boat trip on the Thames or an open bus trip The underground and train station are close too We did a lot of sightseeing on foot walking to see the sights and even enjoy the parks and open spaces The weather was glorious for our stay so having a walk in a shady tree lined area was good during the hottest part of the day After each busy day we didn t have far to go back to the hotel to get changed and ready for the evening Hopefully will visit again soon 
Negative:  as above breakfast was expensive an food quality was poor you get better food at school  |Positive:  room had no window it is noisy with staff talking outside the door I feel ripped off
Negative:  Everything was great I thought we staying across the road which had a pool this one dident |Positive:  Great hotel would stay again the only odd thing was was seats in the bar area were really old tatty and uncomftable which was really odd as everything else was great 
Negative:  Service in bar a little slow but that s just looking for a negative really  |Positive:  On arrival room wasn t ready so they swapped our room and gave all 4 of us a complimentary drink Excellent location to explore London Parking was not with hotel but around corner 20 for 24 hours looks rough but perfectly good service 
Negative:  L italiano restaurant was pretty poor which is a shame because the hotel was wonderful but other than that it was brilliant  |Positive:  I only added a little request in my booking about it being my mums birthday We were overwhelmed with the view the balloons the wine and the card It was one of the best trips to London ever Thank you you made my mother s birthday 
Negative:  hair dryer doesnt work i can ise just once if you are booked on booking com They will give worst room in hotel my room hasnt got any view bathroom isnt so bad |Positive:  pillows smells like french fries but bed was so comfortable 
Negative:  No body answeing phone so i have to come down for any request I requested city view and i was promised to get it if available but when i reach i discovered that all twin room has inside view which i hoped if they told me before  |Positive:  Excellent location clean rooms cooperative staff 
Negative:  We pulled out the sofa bed and used the extra blanket which had a large yellow stain on it and the extra pillows had some stains on the pillow casing  |Positive:  Excellent location Housekeeping was very quick to respond and deliver our requests The night concierge was especially terrific 
Negative:  Considering the price you ve got to have a room overlooking outside  |Positive:  Great staff esp Mariana receptionist good breakfast and location We were allocated in a very small dark twin room for the first night and asked for a room change next day The new room was comfortable with natural light 
Negative:  The fact that the shower flooded the bathroom due to the floor being all one level nice idea in principle but in practice it doesn t work well We had to use some of the towels to dry the floor Also a member of the cleaning staff knocked on our door at about 0830 to see if they could get in to clean the room Checkout wasn t until midday and if we had checked out early then this could have been relayed from reception as to what rooms were ready to clean Disturbed a very rare lie in for my wife and I View from the room was to the inner atrium so all you could see were more rooms This was a shame as being on the 13th floor it would have been nice to have an external window |Positive:  Location was ideal for what we were doing in London thames cruise London dungeons and sea life centre
Negative:  Couldn t alight in front of the hotel as there was road construction blocking the front entrance |Positive:  Can extend late check out up till 6pm by paying 10 pounds per hour
Negative:  We were 3 families and had 3 rooms One of the bathrooms had a clogged shower drain which resulted in the bathroom getting flooded and unable to be used The staff was unapologetic rude and refused to change the room They kept saying they would send someone to fix it but refused to understand that the family living there could not use the shower before starting their day They just shrugged their shoulders and had no solution to the immediate problem at hand which was that the guests who had paid to stay in that room had nowhere to shower They used the showers in the other two rooms we had but we lost out on our morning because of the delay The hotel is located in a popular area and is probably always busy so they really don t care The hotel needs to take their maintenance more seriously to avoid such situations They must consider training their staff to deal with such situations if and when required The only good thing was that they had fixed the shower by the time we returned at night  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Construction near hotel makes it difficult for Taxi to arrive and depart and even walking road is difficult Not a fault of the hotel though I had requested for early check in but room was not ready which forced me to upgrade the room Hotel did not force situation forced me But the upgrade view was good with London eye Big Ben Westminster Abbey all visible from the room window  |Positive:  Excellent location with many major attractions like London Eye Big Ben Parliment houses all at walkable distances 
Negative:  We wanted to buy a bottle of wine from the bar but they didn t have any that was cold as apparantly fridges were broken  |Positive:  The room we had was for 3 people and it was like a mini apartment with a double bedroom small kitchen area and then the sofa bed set up in the lounge Great value between the 3 of us 
Negative:  The location of the twin rooms overlooking the inner courtyard very dark and gloomy this made us change to the next category room which was way better |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Lots of road works going on having to pay for the Internet also breakfast not included in the price expensive but in a good location  |Positive:  In the center of London 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Staff were so helpful to make the night before and morning of my wedding lovely and stress free From providing a special room with a view to assisting with deliveries of flowers etc everything was great The suite with London eye view was wonderful Thanks to all staff particularly concierge 
Negative:  The bed was uncomfortable The TV was tucked in the corner of the room Front desk staff was unpleasant  |Positive:  The front desk staff was unfriendly We got a room facing all the construction Asked for a room not facing the street construction Not sure if the lady at the front desk was having a bad day but she gave a tiny room where the TV was tucked in a corner So only one side of th room could see the TV The bed was horribly uncomfortable 
Negative:  A significant drawback was the sliding glass door of the bathroom which meant that anyone using it during the night woke everyone else up with the noise of the sliding door and the bathroom light lit up the rest of the studio very brightly A proper door would give much better privacy to everyone inside and outside the bathroom  |Positive:  Location and views great Studio itself was lovely with good amenities Soundproofing of the windows was also good 
Negative:  Room was small for a superior room and poorly lit especially as it was an inside room and overlooked the inside wall of the hotel No view therefore needed better lighting within Restaurant tables were not well laid and had to go searching for cutlery at breakfast  |Positive:  Location was good and within easy walking distance of transport Restaurant was ok and staff were friendly and helpful 
Negative:  It might have been useful to know there are roadworks ongoing outside the front entrance This didn t affect me as I was at the back but some customers might have been bothered by the noise  |Positive:  The hotel was lovely staff were friendly and helpful I had an amazing room with a sitting area and kitchenette plus large bathroom with bath and shower Plus I was happy to have been allocated a quiet room Brilliant location about 3 minute walk from Waterloo station 
Negative:  I found that the receptionists although speaking reasonable English were sometimes hard to understand and sometimes it was hard to make them really understand what it was you meant They were however always polite and helpful  |Positive:  being upgraded to a suite It made the hotel visit so much more enjoyable The staff in the dining room were most helpful friendly and welcoming 
Negative:  house keeping kept the door to the room open after cleaning mattress felt little lumpy elevators take forever to come to the 14th floor esp in the morning maybe good idea to allocate an elevator for the top 3 floors only to avoid the over crowd reception staff are not so friendly even little rude and ignorant  |Positive:  gym was well equipped penthouse was spacious and well designed 
Negative:  We were there from Friday afternoon until Sunday and our room was not cleaned on the Saturday they did apologise and gave us fresh towels |Positive:  Everything was perfect especially the Italian restaurant where the food was outstanding Everyone were extremely nice and helpful and I mean everyone 
Negative:  Hotel italian restaurand had automatic 12 5 tip added Small print bottom of receipt and i also left 5 for 56 meal so they got 12 for delivering 2 main courses Failed to mention when i gave extra money Disappointing |Positive:  10 min max walk from waterloo Got bus back to victoria station for airport transfer outside door Had a sick family member and got checking in early and option to upgrade which we gladly accepted for 20 per night
Negative:  Extractor fan in bathroom was on constantly irratating noise when trying to sleep Room was too hot air con was not working as it should  |Positive:  Convenient location
Negative:  Dealt with above  |Positive:  Excellent location for The London Eye Royal Festival Hall and South Bank Staff were very helpful as we had a slight incident with our first room and rectified the situation effectively upgraded us Our Junior Suite had a lovely view over County Hall and the London Eye and was very clean 
Negative:  The only complaint unfortunately was the restaurant area which is nowhere near enough to cater for the number of guests breakfast in particular where the queues at peak times are huge and led to us missing breakfast our second day which we d paid for The warnings are very clear to be fair to avoid peak times but this isn t really the point everyone should be catered for correctly and be able to choose when they want to eat  |Positive:  The whole surroundings of the hotel and in particular the rooms were superbly furnished and catered for The view over the city was outstanding And the location you literally couldn t hand pick a better spot to explore everything in London 
Negative:  The room which we had was meant to be a family room the bed was fine but the children had a sofa bed which was the noisey as hell any time the kids moved in there sleep If squeaked so much  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  the bed was not that comfortable and the temperature of the room was very hot even when the gauge was set to low |Positive:  location of hotel was perfect the staff where very helfull and tended to our ever need 
Negative:  Food in the bar could have been improved I would have liked more choices for breakfast  |Positive:  Agtha in the breakfast room was extremely nice friendly always had a smile on her face so helpful she impressed us the most 
Negative:  The bathroom was a wet room but unfortunately when using the shower water spread across the whole of the floor so you could not use the other facilities until it had drained away which took at least half an hour  |Positive:  The excellent dinner in the restaurant 
Negative:  The drinks were slightly pricey but you have to expect that in London anyway  |Positive:  We upgraded our room as we arrived early and it was only a small extra charge the room was amazing with a great view Staff were really helpful and the location is amazing It s only a 5 minute stroll to the London Eye so you re right in the middle on everything couldn t have asked for more 
Negative:  Staff at check out were a little inexperienced but always polite and trying their best |Positive:  Very children focussed welcome pack on arrival vouchers for icecream and drinks at bar 
Negative:  The promised sauna steam room were not working I phoned the reception they said they were but when I went down they weren t and I wasted half an hour out of a tight schedule needlessly They also didn t respond to my complaint about it Very disappointing  |Positive:  They upgraded my room unrequested and free of charge which i appreciated 
Negative:  We had a drink in the outside veranda at around 23 00 At 10 00 the following day our empty glasses were still where we had left them and the ashtrays were still overflowing Gives a very poor first impression as this is next to the entrance  |Positive:  Upgraded a standard room to a mini suite for just 20 00 
Negative:  The biggest thing is the lifts always when to top floor first and make its way down when it got to our level the lift was full most of the time making us wait longer for a lift  |Positive:  Good location with good size rooms 
Negative:  More space between the door and the bed but that was a very minor issue Road works made walking a bit roundabout but nothing to do with the hotel  |Positive:  The bed was very comfortable and our room very spacious We arrived on an early flight and we re lucky enough to check in early The hotel is in a great location for sightseeing easy access to Waterloo or Westminster stations and close enough to walk to lots of things if you have the time We have stayed here before and would definitely stay again 
Negative:  See above |Positive:  My room was excellent in all respects especially the bed tv bath etc I checked in at 7p and I had not realised that my internet booking did not include breakfast and I had to leave the hotel by 6 45am in the morning a Saturday Breakfast room was opening later than usual as it was a Saturday so no breakfast for this 75 year old At the price I paid for the one night 198 a hot something should have been quickly prepared for me or open the kitchen for a quick sustaining breakfast eg Eggs or porridge etc or given me a packed breakfast 
Negative:  The bed and pillows are very soft which i did not like Also they need a good maintenance for the room facility and i wish if they can change the white lights with yellow lights to get the modern look of the room just an opinion  |Positive:  The room was nice and clean and fully equipped with the essential equipment needed while traveling e g ironing microwave hair dryer etc The hotel is close to London Eye Big Bin 5 10 minutes walking and around 15 25 minutes away from Hyde park and Oxford Street where all the well known shopping shops are Breakfast was fine and the food is delicious 
Negative:  I felt the bathroom could be a little cleaner Because the chrome in the bathroom was not polished up by that I mean just a wipe over with a micro fibre cloth it made me look closer and the bathroom shower cubicle especially taps ect could of been cleaner it was a shame that something so simple let it down for me  |Positive:  Food was excellent Staff were extremely professional and polite 
Negative:  smell of drains sewer in bathroom brekfast too crowded tables too close and knocked by people children pushing past hotel not received booking regarding children |Positive:  location quiet room

Negative:  There wasn t anything we did not like this was our 3rd visit to this hotel and it has been great each time we have stayed  |Positive:  Fantastic nights sleep bed was so comfy 
Negative:  Loads of roadworks around entrance made access on foot tricky Couple of sidelights in room did not work Shower controls a bit of a mystery  |Positive:  Convenience to South Bank attractions and Old Vic theatre
Negative:  Stayed 4 days with my family for the London Marathon Not a good experience The hotel is always crowded and not relaxing Rooms as soon as you enter in a small dark and narrow room near the door you find the bed In the middle there s a small bathroom and kitchenette and near the window another small room with a sofa additional bed Satellite TV always bad signal so you find all the channels available but it is almost impossible to watch a programme without freezing and video problems interruptions The first sign that you see whan you arrive tells that guests have to expect long queues for breakfast and it is true Queues for everything breakfast in the weekends check in elevators The queue for breakfast was the worst one considering that I was with my parents who had to wait 15 mins standing before sitting Inaccurate room cleaning One day room was made at 16 00 the next day they didn t refurbish toilet paper and soap The next one they didn t remove used glasses and dishes The first day they started to knock at the door for service at 8 in the morning with people still in the room Breakfast room cold and inadeguate for the dimensions of this huge hotel Staff not very professional and trained with some exceptions Location near Waterloo station in front of the hotel there is a bus parking so when you are outside waiting for a taxi it is always complicate Beside road works in the street so noise and long alternative routes to cross the street To find some bars Overall this hotel was a terrible choice  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  We booked the restaurant in evening and when we went to pay we asked if we could split the bill as we were with friends and we had our son so ours was more and we were told it would take to much time and he was to busy to do it and we would have to do it ourselves so we then had to go off to one side and get our phones out to work it out for him We paid a lot to stay there and brought another 2 couples with us and I just felt his attitude was not in keeping with a restaurant and hotel like that and I would think twice about dining there again Other than that the other staff were lovely and helpful especially the concierge who was so friendly and helpful  |Positive:  Fab location lovely rooms most of the staff were very helpful would definitely stay again 
Negative:  I did not like breakfast at all Except the omletes cooked by chief Restoran for the breakfast very small so creates long waiting list in front of restaurant  |Positive:  Location was perfect Room service was really good Rooms were clean and tidy all the time

Negative:  The room is a bit dated The fridge is a bit too small since a large part of it was locked  |Positive:  Great location with close proximity to a number of Tube stations
Negative:  The double room was very small with two twin beds and very little room Given the price this was not worth it The breakfast was nice but cost additional 20 pounds per person Also requested a 1 hour late check out and was charged an additional 10 pounds per room Seemed unnecessary  |Positive:  Staff was very accommodating in particular a concierge named Gerry He was pleasant kind and generous even loaned his phone adapter to my son We had two rooms upgraded one to a suite which gave us more room and was a big upgrade to a Superior room Location was great for the London Eye and numerous restaurants in the area 
Negative:  At peak times the queue line for breakfast could be long but either the family room would be open additional seating upstairs or the line would move fairly quickly  |Positive:  The hotel is in a great location with close proximity to Waterloo station It was very easy to get to the hotel from Heathrow Airport via the Heathrow Express and Bakerloo line from Paddington station The staff was very friendly and helpful For a hotel room in Europe the double suite was a good size for a family of four We also had a great view of the London Eye from the 5th floor The children loved their coloring packets and were excited to use their Park Plaza Euros at the bar I would highly recommend this hotel 
Negative:  I wouldn t recommend this location for travelers with cars as parking is difficult and the London Congestion Charge is prohibitive The breakfast lines were a little long but the staff managed very well and kept everyone happy and the breakfast was good  |Positive:  Extremely friendly and helpful staff Good location for tourists who can walk to many attractions A happy and vibey place to stay 
Negative:  Room cleaning could be improved  |Positive:  Cables of open lifts causes steady noise clack clack that disturbs at night in some room After a roomchange it was okay 
Negative:  Upon arrival our superior twin room was very disappointing No external view as requested even though I know not guaranteed Our room which overlooked internal diners was very dark and hot during the night so no other choice except to sleep with the air con on which is not ideal Had it stated upon booking that there was limited rooms with an external view I would not have booked this hotel as for the price you can stay elsewhere that has an external view A nice few days spent in London however would not stay at this hotel again  |Positive:  Good location to Waterloo station 
Negative:  Very tricky getting a reasonable gluten free breakfast despite putting it in the details and phoning ahead Took 3 attempts to get something and several incorrect rounds of information being given despite a 3 year old being coeliac and waiting patiently for his gluten free food Balcony was lovely but it appeared to be the only one missing outside seating which is a missed opportunity given the view Room was a little tired and worn decor wise but a fab size  |Positive:  Overall I d highly recommend this hotel especially for those coming into Waterloo with a young family Fab upgrade to a penthouse fantastic views and very kind and helpful front desk staff Children made very welcome 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Upgraded to a studio for 20 per night Great view over the city Excellent location for Westminster the West End and Waterloo station 30 minutes for a great walk along the Embankment into the City of London 
Negative:  Could hear people walking about the floor |Positive:  Comfty rooms and big as we was on penthouse floor we had stunning view of London eye and big ben would come bk
Negative:  Room I booked was small and dark with no outside window In my opinion it was misrepresented on booking com We would not have been happy there for 5 days  |Positive:  Upgraded room fabulous view excellent service great location
Negative:  Have stayed previously and room was excellent This time it was far too hot even after the maintenance had attended Had to keep curtains closed as air con couldn t keep the room at normal temp  |Positive:  Friendly staff nice restaurant 
Negative:  Breakfast although nice and plenty of choice was far too expensive cheaper and better choice at local restaurants and bars |Positive:  View from the site was excellent location to attractions was first class
Negative:  It took some time for the cleaning service to do the daily cleaning |Positive:  Good location near the key attractions for the family London Eye Shrek Adventure etc The Italian Restaurant was very good excellent Margarita Pizza and Cheese Cake 
Negative:  Air conditioning noisy no ventilation room to hot Room service meal only warm Breakfast disappointing queuing for table then table reset as collecting self service meal Selfservice meal warm mushrooms and tomatoes cold  |Positive:  room was ok and ready early
Negative:  Had to alert maintenance twice on issues which housekeepers should have picked up on and rectified before my arrival Faulty lamp in bedroom and faulty shower head This was POOR Both issues were resolved swiftly and efficiently upon request however Had to alert reception that I was being charged for breakfast on both nights of my stay as my rate quoted was inclusive of breakfast This was POOR  |Positive:  The service reception concierge room service maintenance housekeeping overall was good efficient and friendly Used room service three times The service and food was of a consistently good standard 
Negative:  I purchased the breakfast package but there was limited seating and a long line for breakfast We ate there twice and it was fine but I was disappointed not to be able to take advantage of something I had paid for  |Positive:  Loved the proximity to transportation and activities 
Negative:  Strange definition of city view we could only see the rails of waterloo station Poor breakfast service queuing for 45 minutes before gettting a table in a conference room Being obliged to watch children movie on a big screen while having breakfast Poor quality of food especially bread We had to call the reception every day to have a complete towel set  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Please clean the windows Since there where so many kids staying at the hotel there should be an entertainment room for them The breakfast room is too small and is a pity that there isn t i a coffee machine  |Positive:  The location The feeling of welcome the staff gave us They were very helpful The family room was very roomy and comfortably Its was very good for us to have a laundry room 
Negative:  Standing in line each morning for breakfast was poor not enough tables to support hotel Seemed to stand forever waiting on lifts to and from room level Prices in bar where over the top and had the cheek to charge me 12 5 service charge serving me a beer over the bar  |Positive:  Location and price for family room was main attraction 
Negative:  Warmer welcome would ve been better Appreciate 3 tired dirty but polite workmen walk in to reception may offend But think my money is as good as anyone elses Breakfast was poor especially grey bacon left in bains marie or combi too long Plaza opposite Westminster Bridge much better |Positive:  Nice clean hotel Comfortable bed 
Negative:  The breakfast buffet area was too small We were disappointed about no pool  |Positive:  The beds were very comfortable The rooms were lovely The staff were pleasant 
Negative:  The elevators are so slow and everyone is upset about it Every morning there is a long waiting line for breakfast very frustrating to wait about 20 min for a table  |Positive:  The room was nice 
Negative:  Overall the stay at Park Plaza County Hall met my expectations The only inconvenience was the lifts It felt like you were waiting quite a while for lifts to call at your floor  |Positive:  The room was small but clean and comfortable The staff were friendly and helpful The breakfast was very good with traditional english breakfast food The hotel was conveniently located near Waterloo train station Westminster via a short walk over Westminster Bridge as well as the London Eye and numerous restaurants coffee shops and pubs The gym facilities were very nice with the added bonus of a sauna and steam room The concierge and bell man services were very helpful and professional 
Negative:  Parents room quite small no view they were looking into middle of hotel bathrooms could be improved very big step to get over into bath and no lock on bathroom doors  |Positive:  Really nice helpful staff perfect location Family room good for up to family of 4 
Negative:  Room was probably a bit smaller than expected and the staff were generally very good breakfast area was a bit crowded and the breakfast tables and seats were very close together breakfast service was a bit hap hazard particularly when queueing for eggs |Positive:  Location of hotel is fantastic particularly small kids who don t want to spend too much time walking we had a great weekend break
Negative:  one of the hotel stuff ruined our bag by mistake they didnt offer any compensation |Positive:  very good resturant close to london eye and big ben very comfort with smart tv
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Receptionist from Italy sorry i forgot her name she s very nice to us saying welcome to London and to the property she also upgraded our room with a fantastic view of the Big Ben and Londoneye during our 4 nights stay 
Negative:  Restaurant is very unexciting and feels a bit like a cafeteria Bar area unexciting too Felt this was a shame as did not encourage use of either  |Positive:  Room gave you privacy whilst accommodating a family and the location with the easy access to Waterloo and the river The view from the room was great 
Negative:  City view through Waterloo railway not nice at all limited number of adapters available at reception early breakfast recommended or longer waiting time  |Positive:  Comfy room and bed very helpful staff good breakfast near to Waterloo tube bus trains near to Westminster Bridge and London Eye
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Stay was wonderful Staffs were friendly Enjoyed the yummy breakfast especially the scrambled eggs Loved the room and we got upgraded to a bigger room Would definitely come back 
Negative:  Breakfast was average with some of the food a bit bland Lifts were terrible and expected better but overall a good stay |Positive:  Location and views from the rooms we had were good
Negative:  The breakfast option seemed good but we didn t book it as it was too expensive per person Perhaps more pricing options would have encouraged us to take breakfast in the hotel  |Positive:  When we checked in we were given a complimentary upgrade to our room and it was amazing The staff were friendly welcoming and helpful nothing was too much trouble for them 
Negative:  the breakfast is so basic for its price The food assortment is very limited for the price of 20 pounds I can go and have much better breakfast in the cafe I also recommend to come earlier for the breakfast because the restaurant is not big and possibly you will have to wait for the table |Positive:  good location and big room number you also have the little kitchen in the room
Negative:  there was no welcome water bottled at the room and there was no black tea in the mini bar the TV is located in one side and it hard to watch TV from the other bed side  |Positive:  Location of the hotel is very good and the kids gift is a nice idea specially the park plaza money 
Negative:  Room 1024 and the filthy windows which were so dirty you couldn t see out of them Staff were happy to show us alternatives but perhaps it would be better to employ a window cleaner  |Positive:  Impossible not to like this hotel Great staff super breakfast which is free for kids and even cheaper if you pre book at check in We also used room service who provided a delicious supper at sensible prices The staff even prepared a lovely little chocolate cake for our daughter s birthday with a signed card a great little detail We were initially booked into room 1024 which faces onto the Westminster Plaza dark and dank plus the windows were so dirty you couldn t see out of them To be fair the staff were very flexible and offered us a tour of alternative rooms We decided on a junior suite room 1027 which looked out on Big Ben County Hall and the Eye It did cost 20 more but if you re doing this trip just once go for it Worth noting that the traffic here isn t too busy at night and a taxi back is not too expensive 
Negative:  We were able to hear our neighbours which was a bit offputting Also we could hear the restaurant noise as it was directly below us We didn t take advantage of the breakfast which we were glad of as the queue for breakfast was very long at 8 30 am  |Positive:  The hotel was in an excellent location 5 mins walk to London Eye and Westminster Bridge The staff were very helpful we even received an upgraded room as our allotted room was not ready Everything was just as I expected from a large chain hotel The room was clean and well stocked and the shower in the bathroom was amazing 
Negative:  Wardrobe inside light was not going off when closing the doors so was lit all night Poor views from our room though just used it for overnight mostly WIFI poor speed  |Positive:  Housekeeping excellent Two TVs good thinking 
Negative:  Rooms were sometimes not made during the day Restaurant was not big enough to cope with breakfast |Positive:  Location makes this a clear choice Was easy to get to and close to the attractions and inner city
Negative:  This room was not worth 200 night I believe that the Premier Inn adjacent to this hotel would have offered a more comfortable room with better bathroom facilities The amount of space around the bed offered little chance of decent movement around the room The wardrobe was inadequate in size to offer enough clothing storage space for 2 room guests The bathroom sliding glass door could only be fully closed using great force is liable to break should a strong young man use such force In this case it could result in that person sustaining injury I would suggest that you use this tiny room as a storeroom  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Room cleaning was great when they did it But there were a couple days we came back from being gone all day and they hadn t gotten to our room yet Not a big deal but worth mentioning |Positive:  Breakfast was definitely one of the best parts of this hotel To be able to get up in the morning with two kids and have a full breakfast made was invaluable My kids could not get enough of Agatha one of the breakfast hosts she was fantastic Which made the mornings a breeze 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  location is the best of all 3min walk to westminster bridge Super helpful staff proper modern star hotel better value than the Park Plaza Hotel opposite to it 
Negative:  Breakfast could have been better coffee was very poor on the 3 mornings  |Positive:  Location room was lovely and staff were very nice Hotel was clean and restaurant had reasonably priced menu Security was good too as they asked for room card at night Overall it is s lovely hotel and would recommend to friends and family visiting London 
Negative:  Some of the bathroom towels were frayed and worn looking  |Positive:  We had a complimentary upgrade to a penthouse room which was lovely Having said that I always find the rooms very clean and quiet 
Negative:  The cost was a bit too expensive but considering the location I ll make an exception The noise of people opening and closing doors was immense Also the sound of water running through the pipes from upstairs was very loud It was evident everytime someone flushed the toilet The sound proofing needs a bit of work to say the least Lack of USB chargers in a modern hotel is questionable  |Positive:  The location was perfect The hotel was clean and modern looking The staff was friendly 
Negative:  The fact that you couldnt open the windows unless you was on pent house level was misleading I did not like this at all THe temperature in the room was constantly boiling even if heater was off I asked to move room and turned out I couldnt as none of them have windows Not good  |Positive:  The little kitchen in the room 
Negative:  Reception for my mobile phone |Positive:  The room was exceedingly comfortable very very clean much better than some London 5 star rooms very impressed one tiny problem was I had zero connection to my phone breakfast was excellent price very good I will definitely stay again as the hotel is perfectly situated for the heart of London 
Negative:  A picture is worth a thousand words Added photos are not taken from a construction site this is central London and what you see through your window if you can after paying about 200euros per night in a 4 star hotel not like the amazing photos on the website right Needless to say the view is accompanied by construction noises starting at 7 30 am in the working days Sure they do have double glazed glasses but I am a very light sleeper and requested an upper storey room for this reason in my reservation Seems no one reads or cares what is written there In the room there was no coffee machine as declared on the booking com website the hot water pressure was so low that a quick shower took ages Housekeepers knocked our door two times by mistake as they thought we need additional sheets or a sofa bed After all yes the room was clean excluding the muddy windows and spacious but the rest was enough to ruin our anniversary We will never step in Park Plaza again even if it is the only hotel in town and I will make sure that this outstanding quality will be seen and known by as many as other people so that same cannot happen to them  |Positive:  The best thing was the location of the hotel
Negative:  We had an internal view quite disconcerting Would have requested to change it had we stayed longer |Positive:  Fantastic central location Came into Waterloo and walked from the hotel everywhere We arrived early but were still able to check in which was a bonus and facilitated changing shoes and using the bathroom Good breakfast
Negative:  It was very very pricey to stay here The breakfast on day 2 had a long line and it did not seem that they had an organized plan to seat people for breakfast  |Positive:  The location is great and the property is modern clean and comfortable The Italian restaurant was fantastic and the wait staff was very attentive The breakfasts were plentiful and delicious The bar at night stayed open late and we had a great time 
Negative:  I wish the staff could speak better English I found it very difficult at times to be understood and for them to understand me and the food and everything was nice but the service could have been faster I m not sure why waiting staff didn t think to come back after they ve dropped your meal to see if you would like something else or tea coffee dessert etc A small thing but annoying  |Positive:  It is really well located and a very nice hotel The facilities are good and bed comfortable and the room pretty quiet for London The restaurant and food were excellent and pretty good value As a lone traveller I felt very safe and comfortable there 
Negative:  Because we stayed six days and ate the breakfast on site every day because we paid for the included breakfast it would have been nice if they had changed up the menu from one day to the next It would have been really great if they had offered French Toast pancakes or waffles sigh But that said we had no problem with being seated right away as some reviewers have And the food was fresh and hot with plenty available  |Positive:  We stayed in an executive suite and it was very nice Water pressure was great in the shower a big plus in my book and the sofa bed was very comfortable Also the property was very clean and every staff member we had contact with was friendly and helpful Great stay overall I would definitely recommend the hotel to anyone who wants to be close to the Westminster area and or plans to do much day tripping as Waterloo Station will connect you with just about anywhere you want to go 
Negative:  The room size was smalle the temperature in room very hot there is no buses or tubes stations neer from hotel The waterloo station 10min walking from the hotel The hotel doesn t provide room dining 24 hours and just one restaurant in the hotel which is italian restaurant  |Positive:  The room was clean The staff were very friendly The laundry service was good but expensive
Negative:  The rooms was not big enough for 2 or 3 persons We asked for 3 beds but did only get 1 bed and 1 crap sofa The WC dosen t have a proper door so there is no privacy  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Hard to find anything wrong My single room was tiny but this is normal for Central London  |Positive:  Very high levels of service met at check in with a hot towel and a fruit drink and had my bags carried to my room Super friendly and polite staff Good value at 162 actually cheaper than the nearest Premier Inn that night 
Negative:  HD TV was confusing and I am not convinced was working properly That is ITV1 continually showed a Sky trailer I could not get any ITV1 programs TV guide was also not working  |Positive:  Room layout was highly original and excellent Breakfast 
Negative:  The shower didn t work and wasn t looked at until the 2nd evening of our 2 night stay after we spoke to reception the afternoon of our day of arrival the following morning and afternoon The room was incredibly hot despite also informing reception of this on the 3 occasions we complained about the shower We were told the room temperature was controlled by computer and that it would be adjusted This was never done I was also given a discount card and told I could use this for a 5 discount on the hotel bar and restaurants When I purchased a rum and ginger at the bar I was told this discount was for soft drinks only and charged the full 9 90 for my drink that s not a typo it was nearly 10  |Positive:  The location was good for access to attractions and central London all in walking distance
Negative:  Nothing  |Positive:  Great service friendly staff and perfect location We were lucky enough to have the room upgraded and so it simply could t have been better 
Negative:  1 Frontdesk is soso I asked for an adampter wehn I checked in and was told I have to come tomorrow morning 9 00am When I came eary in the following moring they said it is first come first get and dont have any So I have to buy one in B1 Suggest the hotel to tell the client clearly what you can help and if you can t let us know as well 2 The price is higher compared with its service  |Positive:  The location is excellent 5 10 minutes walk to Waterloo station and can walk to many famous places such as Big Ben London eye Hyde park Buckingham palace Britis Museum etc 
Negative:  The underground Waterloo is very busy between 8 30 9 00 am we had to wait for six trains before we could ride along in a cart stuck like sardines in a can We arrived at the wrong chain reception showed us no smile at all didnt appoligized that we are at the wrong location She just did not care at all But this is the case in all London hotels I ve noticed Specially with the east European staff members Their accent showed through The sighing especially so rude Spending 200 a night should not give this service at all most annoying point was that we mentioned that we want a business invoice and mentioned it on booking com but they refuse to give us ons Only after consulting the manager we were granted what we wanted As a business traveler this is not convenient and very time consuming and annoying  |Positive:  Location was great but hidden behind their big brother from the same chain The restaurant served excellent food for reasonable prices The reception gave us discount coupons and upon their recomm we ate their Room were soundproof so we could have all the piece to study for an exam Big Ben at walking distance Great view from the hotel 
Negative:  Our superior twin room was small and dark overlooking a narrow internal courtyard which meant that we had to have the light on at all times of day Not very comfortable and not good value  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  I requested a higher floor room but assigned a 1st floor room In the room the door s inside key was broken so could not lock The bed was terribly hard and I had a backache next day  |Positive:  Location
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  If you are looking for sightseeing this is the place to stay as everything is close to this hotel The couch became a double bed while we had a king size double bed as well When we walked in everyone was open and started complimenting me and my friends 
Negative:  The airconditioner was warm and I found out just on the last night when I asked for a fan that the temps can be dropped by the staff It would have been nice to know that is advance pre authorization on your CC is needed in advance if u want to order room service Should be part of the initial CC pre authorization I shouldn t be paying each time I order something  |Positive:  Nice touristic location close to Wesminister and Big Ben Walking distance to London eye and many attractions Waterloo station is a 5 min walk and is serviced by a good bus network There is also a Starbucks for coffee lovers 2 minutes away 
Negative:  Not much to complain about perhaps the price but then again given the position  |Positive:  Position is hard to beat slap bang in the middle of the city a 2min walk to the London Eye Really good place 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Both the food and the location were wonderful The staff was very helpful and quick to comply all of our requests We ll definitely be coming back again 
Negative:  The burger was a bit scary Other in our group had the chicken burger which was ok I requested a late check out the night we checked in The receptionist said to call in the morning a charge of 10pnds an hour I called in the morning at 8AM to arrange the late check out only to be told it was now not ok they need the room After that there were 5 phone calls through out the morning up until 11 30 A little funny they were desperate for this room and we had to experience 5 hang ups through out the morning not relaxing knowing they want you out as soon as possible  |Positive:  The room was great and had a view of the train station A beautiful night view We had a great tapas platter in the bar Doormen where excellent Checkin was fast and easy I requested a late check out the night we checked in The receptionist said to call in the morning a charge of 10pnds an hour I called in the morning at 8AM to arrange the late check out only to be told it was now not ok they need the room After that there were 5 phone calls through out the morning up until 11 30 A little funny they were desperate for this room and we had to experience 5 hang ups through out the morning not relaxing knowing they want you out as soon as possible

Negative:  Didn t like coming home because had a great time  |Positive:  Liked hotel staff location room cleanliness view and the general simplicity and helpful support you need when travelling as a family

Negative:  the breakfast was lovely with plenty of option just the scrambled egg was nasty very rubbery and bland |Positive:  The upgrade and welcoming members of staff who greated and treated us to an upgrade on arrival as it was a special occasion for us really did make our stay at the park plaza enjoyable and a happy memory Thankyou
Negative:  Wasn t happy with the main shower head not working properly coming out at different angles and water ended up on the ceiling and the floor making it very dangerous to walk on |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The sofa bed was not that clean so I phoned the reception asking for cleaning the bed and the cleaning staff came but they were not nice I waited for the lift for around 15 mins 3 lifts are not enough  |Positive:  Nice reception staff wide room excelent location good restaurant closed to private car park
Negative:  Shower Bath water was cold called reception several times and nothing was sorted Came in on Saturday night and the staff on reception was so close with each other flirting and touching each other made me feel so uncomfortable The room wasn t cleaned even though we left the sign on the door I feel disappointed with the stay when paying so much money I would like to be able to be in contact with manager As I would like a refund  |Positive:  The view from the room was brilliant 
Negative:  breakfast was not included and really should had been for the price i paid  |Positive:  nice comfortable room and very great location lovely food in the restaurant italia very good standard 
Negative:  When we arrived our city view consisted of the train station next to the hotel Asked for a room with a proper city view and the only available room was the penthouse at cost Decided to upgrade and it was worth every penny  |Positive:  The Penthouse fantastic views 
Negative:  Carpet was a little shabby and bathroom had seen better days but these are not cheap or easy fixes The room was internal and the only window faced onto the Restaurant so there was no natural light Not a problem for me pitch black makes me sleep like the dead but my sister wasn t keen But for only 2 nights it was perfectly liveable  |Positive:  Staff were excellent mentioned on booking that we were there to celebrate my mother s 60th birthday and the staff upgraded her room put a bottle of wine and a card and wrote a birthday message on the window My mother was delighted and this is the kind of thing that customer service is all about going the extra All of the staff we came across were helpful friendly and knowledgeable Special thanks to Elizabetta on Reception and Marta in the Bar they re the only names I remember and I hope I got them right Room was a very good size plenty of facilities provided including a microwave and crockery 
Negative:  Just need reception staff to work on their grasp of understanding the customer It took a few attempts to make myself clear |Positive:  Staff mostly from oversees were very engaging and accommodating I liked how efficient and organised the staff were in queuing and sitting people for breakfast It was a perfect example of everyone knowing what they were doing I liked the housekeeping service They followed instruction well and appropriately and were discreet and accommodating Reception staff were warm

Negative:  Lack of parking mitigated by valet service which however costs 45 for 24 hours which might put off some people  |Positive:  Travelling to London was stressful as I had never driven into London before however it was not as difficult as I had anticipated it was easy to pull up at the hotel and park temporarily it is unfortunate to know that the hotel does not have parking on site this was however this was mitigated by the hotel having valet service which was excellently efficient however left me out of pocket to the tune of 45 however this was still cheaper and less stressful than using public transport The hotel itself was beautiful the accommodation we had was tastefully decorated you could see a lot of thought and investment was put into it the bed was comfortable i m sad to say it was better than our own for a fantastic experience I would recommend the last floor 14th the views were fantastic from the balcony The staff were excellent you could tell they didn t just pluck anyone from the streets give them a 10 minute induction and let them loose they were very knowledgeable and eager to help without being intrusive I can t comment on their food as we didn t eat there there is plenty of restaurants around though can t rate them though as we only used one which was actually good The sites nearby were excellent which was the main reason for our trip The london Eye Parliarment Big Ben London Dungeons amongst others were all within a very short walking distance away others could easily be reached either by train or buses All in all I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone 
Negative:  Lack of extra pillows Our room smelt when we first went into it wasn t pleasant We waited 15 minutes for a lift and ended up taking the stairs Our room keys kept failing to let us in our room we must of had them re programmed 4 times When we returned to our room about 11pm there were children playing football in the lift area near the restaurant which I thought was really bad as no staff seemed to be stopping them I requested early book in but was not given this although they stored our bags for us which helped I wouldn t stop here again for money we paid  |Positive:  The bed was really comfy The location was great 
Negative:  Nothing It was all good  |Positive:  The staff were very welcoming and helpful The room was great it was very comfortable and clean The restaurant was excellent and we throughly enjoyed out meal there The location is fantastic for seeing a large area of Central London by foot but is equally great for access to the tube at Westminster

Negative:  The gym equipment was OK but not as high standard as the rest of the hotel however it had a gym which is unusual for a London hotel in this price range  |Positive:  Giulia who checked me in very helpful as were all the other staff The room was outstanding and had lots of extra equipment like a microwave and coffee machine 
Negative:  Everything else I booked an executive studio room and upgraded to city view the other week The stay was for myself and my parents I havent seen them in a long time and it was meant to be a family weekend out before I get married Firstly booking com has advertised the room I was booking with a picture of the room with a view to London Eye or Big Ben Did we get that view Not at all And we could barely get in the room as the sofa bed was so close to the door My mom is disabled so I went to the reception and told them that they must have gotten the room incorrect So they changed our room to a Junior Suite which just had a window overlooking the waterloo train station I have told one of the staff members that we upgraded on booking com and had to have a view to Big ben or London eye which they said is not their fault and theres the Shard building somewhere far away that we can slightly see and because the Shard is in the city this is the City view You can say that pretty much about anything I appreciate they changed our room to a bigger one until I realised that the Spa bookings I have made for myself and my mother have not been made Complained to the reception they said its not their fault again and they can try and fit one of us in at some point during our stay There were missing bulbs in pretty much every lamp in the room my moms duvet had a blood stain on have photo proof I have also requested to have an extra duvet as my parents dont like sharing one had to ask twice although it was written in the notes The next morning after the room was cleaned the extra duvet was gone again I have never had a worse stay in a hotel in my life  |Positive:  The location is good but you would expect that for this sort of money anyway 
Negative:  We are a family of 4 on arrival first day complementary toiletries not enough had to call house keeping for more Second day was out most of the day sight seeing got back at 5 15 room just cleaned left us with 2 towels only no toiletries had to ring house keeping again  |Positive:  The room was spacious and very comfortable The choice for the breakfast was amazing 
Negative:  Found the bed for the children very uncomfortable it was a pull out sofa bed Unfortunately they didn t sleep very well We had a studio room with a different layout on this occasion the rooms were only partitioned with a desk and pillar rather than the bathroom which makes it more practical so it wasn t as seperate as we would have liked and as easy for them to get to sleep unless we turned our lights off too might be worth requesting this with the hotel  |Positive:  Lovely clean room fantastic location which is why we book here very good for the tube clipper to reach all the attractions London has to offer Usually had a great experience but didn t match previous visits here this one was our third 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We had an excellent stay at Park Plaza County Hall Reception and concierge staff were very polite and helpful We will definately try to stay here on our next break in London 
Negative:  The fact that the restaurant shows you special deals but they don t actually offer it you I found the room freezing even after turning air con off and switched to warm and the fact that I paid extra to have breakfast in bed and they only brought my husbands breakfast and forgot my porridge and only came back to say they had forgotten it as we was about to check out so I paid for breakfast as a package and then extra for room service and never recieved it and never got a refund  |Positive:  I liked the friendly staff warm welcome and beautiful clean rooms

Negative:  Staff at the reception wasn t helphul at all Was asked to pay although had paid for the stay the evening before After explaining my situation she requested a different card Being not very fluent in English I couldn t properly defend my position after what she asked my nationality and told me you can go Very surprised that a central London hotel can be so rude and insensitive Deep disappointment and unpleasant feeling for the rest of the day  |Positive:  Location
Negative:  We booked a studio with a double and sofa bed The sofa bed is so bad I literally went to a e with severe neck pain Do not sleep on the sofa bed Also very surprised that no Ow came to clean the room until 6 pm We had been out since 8am  |Positive:  Location is great staff were great
Negative:  Limited channels at TV Limited sugar for tea hahaha And very limited milk It was not which we was expected for the value which we paid |Positive:  Hmmm the bed was nice and clean
Negative:  Useless staff in Bar We had to ask five times if we could order drinks Each time they said they would take our order at our table The final time we insisted they took our order at the Bar but still no one made any effort to organise drinks It wasn t busy I have no idea why the four staff were unable to provide an adequate service It was bizarre  |Positive:  Helpful check in staff at Reception 
Negative:  Your staff did not know where to pool is and instructed me to visit the neighboring park plaza building to be humiliated when I asking if I have my room card and if I am a resident The talk continued for 10 minutes where every service which I originally came for was not available Hence this hotel although modern and pricy is nothing more than a unorganized scam But good job you took my money you are good capitalists |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The rooms have no windows and very much dislike the air conditioning The rooms are too hot and not comfortable which meant I didn t sleep until 3am You can hear the lifts all night and they are noisy and I m a light sleeper Also every time I ve been to the hotel my room is never ready much preferred the park plaza hotel across the road  |Positive:  I like the location and the look Of hotel the facilities are nice and the decor is of good quality 
Negative:  Room was too hot could not get the temperature down |Positive:  good size room and even though I did not use it I liked that there was a kitchen area with a microwave

Negative:  A couple of little niggles Fridge part of the minibar wasn t cold enough and the room was too warm despite having the air con on max Perhaps it being so cold out meant they turned the heating up  |Positive:  Great location close to the London Eye right next to Waterloo station Family room was a good set up with different sleeping areas for us and the kids and kitchenette was useful Overall a really good stay 
Negative:  The temperature of the hotel our room wouldn t warm up even after putting the temperature to max Also the microwave wasn t present in the room as was expected to be included  |Positive:  The breakfast was super delicious the layout of the room was spot on

Negative:  Paid for upgrade to see London Eye Big Ben Eye was fab view couldn t see Big Ben did complain and got half of upgrade fee back if you want to see Big Ben too need higher than 7th floor Also for price we paid would have been nice to have breakfast included An additional 20 a head didn t seem fair when spending over 200 on a room  |Positive:  Lovely location and hotel really nice and comfortable
Negative:  Shower creates a bit of a puddle as the door didn t shut properly |Positive:  Hotel was absolutely perfect Concierge staff were fantastic as were front desk which made check in out a breeze We requested a room with a view as it was a special occasion and we had an amazing view with complimentary wine 
Negative:  I paid for an executive suite with city view as it stated on the website What I got was a room on the 11 th floor overlooking the side of the Park Plaza Westminster across the road and part of the construction site from Waterloo train station Very unhappy about this I was told at reception I could look forward to a great view from my room the windows were filthy to so good luck taking any photos of your stunning view James quirk |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  Additional beds for kids sofa bed was very uncomfortable and smelled because of humidity Air conditioning was bad too no fresh air can be found inside building  |Positive:  Good personel and smiling faces 
Negative:  Staff rather rude and dismissive on check in which was nt a great start after a long journey Check out was lengthy so opted to drop keys in the Express Box Bedroom layout was odd TV in front to dresser instead of a mirror That was on the inside of the wardrobe door which then had to be left open which wasnt ideal Room was SO hot air con had no effect and no window could be opened Bathroom door is frosted glass and faces the bed so no matter how comfortable you and your partner are is still really not good Little confusing as there are 2 Park Plazas next to each other Food Drink is dear but its London so Nothing close for a drink unless you walk to the Southbank which we did but everywhere closed around 9 30 so hotel has a captive audience as it were Overall a nice but pricey stay  |Positive:  Location was good 
Negative:  check in staff not helpful lobby small and therefore always crowded Breakfast room feels like a fast food restaurant Far too small when hotel is full especially with families They call it executive rooms although there was no executive lounge Elevators too slow for number of guests Have stayed often in London but this was the least appealing hotel There are certainly many better options  |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  Overpriced for New Years eve paid 400 per room per night and when asked if we could have a room facing the fireworks they wanted another 800 per night Total extortion dirty small and below average room Wouldn t pay more than 40 a night Had to take 3 small children outside to watch in the freezing cold at 11 30pm because they would not let us have a room facing the fireworks Rooms were empty because people refused to pay 800 they wanted  |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  We were 2 parents and child The added fold up bed was positioned where you would expect the fixed bed to be and vice versa The elevators seem to be insufficient for the large number of rooms When checking out it was very difficult to actually make it down to recepcion because every time the elevator passed it was already full with people And no matter how nice a hotel might be when it s time to go it s time to go  |Positive:  Location is excellent across the river from Big Ben and parliament

Negative:  Didnt like that although featured in promotional pictures there was no way the London Eye could be seen from anywhere in the hotel Also that the bathroom sink was blocked The burgers we ordered from room service came with no condiments No Ketchup in the burgers or as compliments and that it took room service another 25 mins instead of the couple they promised to brings some by which time we had eaten the burgers to prevent them getting cold Very Poor Also the pasta in the Italian restaurant was poor and our we were given an additional dish we did not order  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  There were no face wash cloths provided this was a challenge No onsite variety store selling basic vacation items such as varied drinks confectionery items vacation supplies likely to be required  |Positive:  Bed was comfy service was excellent staff accommodating and informative room cleaning excellent attention to detail good etc
Negative:  The room Inside room with view of the dining room Could not open the window Could not control the air conditioning Was advised the morning after our stay that we needed to ask reception if we needed cold air as it was controlled from downstairs The tap on the bathroom sink was very loose The tap on the bath was very stiff the setting was programmed for hand shower use so my friend got quite a surprise soaking when she tried to turn on the shower and one of the turning spikes handle broke off in my hand when I tried to turn it Could not control the water temperature so ended up filling the bath from the hand shower unit with boiling water and taking a bath when the water cooled down Advised reception of the issues after breakfast and 2 plumbers came up to the room straight away where they proceeded to tighten the sink tap and look at the shower bath controls Both agreed that they were not right They also pointed out that there was no visibility of the hot cold bath shower info on the taps as this appeared to have rubbed off We spoke to the manager who offered to refund our breakfast but not the cost of the room Cannot fault the staff polite and efficient but a little disappointed that no refund part refund was offered The front of house manager gave us his card and advised me to email these details on our return  |Positive:  The bed was comfy and the breakfast was good

Negative:  Room was quite cold only air conditioning was available and not needed considering its winter Buffet breakfast was nice but area is too small considering the number of people we saw each morning Luckily with a 6 year old we were early for breakfast only saw queues on leaving Tables very cramped and area cold with lobby doors constantly being opened Small things i noticed were no facecloths in bathroom or cleaning liquid cloth for kitchenette  |Positive:  Check in staff member was extremely helpful and friendly Helped to sort out my mistake of booking that day arriving by train a few hours later to find i had booked for a week later Helped with sorting out a room with a view of London Eye Big Ben as it wasnt available on booking com website

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  When we arrived we mentioned it was our daughters 3rd bday and they upgraded us to the penthouse immediately just because and when we got to the room there was a birthday message on the window a card and balloons in the room it made our weekend this penthouse has the best views of London I have ever seen best room we ve ever stayed in by far Sadly our 3 year old got sick and we had to stay an extra night and the hotel were able to move us into another room straight away sadly she was sick on the covers and we asked for new sheets whilst apologising the staff were more than understanding and kind to us and we can t thank the hotel enough the staff were incomparable 
Negative:  1 Food choices of breakfast are too limited |Positive:  1 Decent room considering the price 2 Room has microwave silverware and Nespresso machine 2 Good location close to Waterloo
Negative:  Reception staff We paid in full upon arrival and got charged the entire amount 3 times again They were argumentative and refused to believe us so we had to show them our account statement We also got charged small random amounts each day and there were 8 extra things on our mini bar bill that we didn t have It was lucky we checked the charges They refused to be at all apologetic or seem empathetic  |Positive:  Location Laundry
Negative:  Room was very compact for 2 people If we had been a hurry to get out it is difficult for 2 people to not keep running up against each other The big heavy glass sliding door on the bathroom was noisy to move  |Positive:  Location was excellent for London sights and Theatre land Rooms were well kitted out and bed was big and comfortable

Negative:  Room felt slightly damp  |Positive:  The food was excellent and staff we helpful room wasn t ready when i arrived 2 hours later than supposed to be but was offered free drink x 2 to make up for it 
Negative:  I was a little put off by the style of the bathroom door translucent glass slider because it didn t allow for as much privacy as I would like I also wished they had mentioned at check in that you use your key card to activate the light switches because it took us a few minutes to figure that out when we got in Maybe they said it and we missed it  |Positive:  Bed was comfortable staff was extremely courteous room cleaning was superb location is great I also loved having kitchen facilities in the room 
Negative:  The advertising pictures of the hotel make it look very nice but much different when you experience it yourself The Check in was delayed by about 15 minutes yet had to go up a second time asking about when will we be given the key to the room Very poor check in and unproffessional No sink in the room had to use water from the toilet sink to boil the water There is no toothpaste in the bathrooms to brush your teeth with The access to the internet on the tv is blocked Very dissapointed can find much better hotels for the same price  |Positive:  Right in the city centre short walking distances to attractions 
Negative:  Toiletries were a bit scarce 1 bottle of each for a family of 4 is a bit too little had to ask housekeeping for more every time which they provided with no problems |Positive:  Breakfast was very good esp since there was soy milk and gluten free cereal Kitchenette in room was an added bonus Staff very friendly and helpful
Negative:  Nothing  |Positive:  Everything The rooms are as what they publish My son loves sataying in this hotel Thisbis probably our third time staying here The staff and the facilities are great for a small family We were checked into our room 20 mins after check in time but they made it up with a bottle of complimentary red wine which we enjoyed that night Would always recommend this hotel to friends and family 
Negative:  More choice of films on tv |Positive:  Comfy bed Very quiet Floor to ceiling windows made a small room light Outlook onto County Hall roundabout strangely great Housekeeping v prompt Perfect for a short stay
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We got a free upgrade to penthouse which was amazing Looking onto London eye was my daughter s 18th so made it more special staff were lovely and very helpful 
Negative:  Ground coffee and a biscuit would have made it better  |Positive:  The bed was comfortable beautiful shower room and bath with Elemis products Tea and coffee making facilities in room 
Negative:  Booked for New Year s Eve spent 2660 for two rooms two nights because told London eye view London eye view bull had to go outside and stand in street after bought tickets home page shows London eye they wanted another 2000 pound to upgrade shocking |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Booked executive suite with view but the view we got was rail way station which was a bit disappointing Was hoping for river eye view Also there were 3 of us staying there but only given 2 cups wine glasses etc and when we called room service reception to request another glass we were told it was on its way but never arrived  |Positive:  Great location and late check out was good 
Negative:  the staff were a little slow but vert polite so no faults  |Positive:  loved the location and the room and view was to die for great value for money will defo be back 
Negative:  We ordered room service after waiting an hour for it they missed the milk for our tea and the pizza Base was doughy We were left to it at breakfast and had nearly finished before we managed to get some ones attention for a warm drink Then they only brought us one and not two When checking out we never got the option or chance to give any feedback about our stay  |Positive:  The chap that checked us in was very friendly and helpful
Negative:  The amenities in the room such as plates and utensils are not properly washed before being placed back in the cupboard The bathroom sink was clogged the first day we came in The bed is not very comfortable back support is not adequate There is not enough room for breakfast |Positive:  The location is ideal for tourists visiting the london eye and westminster
Negative:  Literally no wardrobe space We stayed for 4 nights and had to leave our clothes in suitcase Not sure it was value for money over New Years Eve The hotel decided to charge 109 00 for the buffet in restaurant on New Years Eve which I felt was cashing in on the whole event They wanted to charge an extra 700 for view upgrade which I thought was cashing in Bar very small no where to relax once a few families are in the bar  |Positive:  Fantastic location Nice modern rooms Very helpful staff 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We love the Park Plaza County Hall because it is so convenient to everything London It is close to Parliament Westminster Abbey and the Eye We love the close pubs and restaurants The train station is two blocks away 
Negative:  When we booked hotel back in Jan 16 we requested room with a view of London eye In November had email to say our room did not have a view We could upgrade for 300 a night Unfortunately we could not cancel booking without loosing full amount So we had no choice We were on Level 4 and waited on average 20 30 minutes for 1 of 4 lifts Really bad On arrival we were offered Breakfast at an additional cost which we agreed on First morning there was a que of about 45 minutes for a seat in the dining room Not what I would have expected for this class of hotel  |Positive:  The beds and pillows were comfortable Tea and coffee facilities in room 
Negative:  That fact I booked a penthouse suite for New Year s Eve on the basis we had a view of the London eye based on the images used booking com On arrival we were advised that our room was south facing meaning we had no view of the fireworks what so ever |Positive:  View was exceptional
Negative:  There seems to be some miscommunication between this hotel and Booking com We arrived on Christmas day and the hotel was fully booked Upon arrival it turned out that we were allocated two rooms on two separate floors even though I specifically indicated we require either a suite or two connected rooms as we have four little children I even received an email confirmation from the hotel s reservation center for this The staff at the front desk was super very nice and they did their best to solve the issue Eventually they upgraded us to a penthouse at the 14th floor which was great The troubles continued the next day and every day thereafter as my booking for breakfast did not go through either and they had to charge me for each breakfast  |Positive:  Overall we had a very good experience The location is quite good 2 min walk from the London eye across the bridge from Big Ben it is very clean and comfortable The staff is very friendly and helpful They literally saved our trip see the cons part Bottom line Very good experience
Negative:  Ridiculously overpriced Couldn t cont them on phone number on their website or booking com booking page Staff unfriendly and unhelpful Included breakfast was basic boring and cold Bathroom temperature always set to very high temperature Laundry facilities inadequate we re traveling g for 2 months There for a week and housekeeping room maintenance worse each day Bed not made properly Dirty cups and room service tray left in room plus rubbish Would not recommend this hotel to anyone Email I sent still unanswered  |Positive:  Well promoted Looked ideal as our chosen location for watching NYE London fireworks Short walk from Waterloo Station 
Negative:  Management is arrogant and unhelpfull Breakfast queues of half an hour way to small restaurant for busy times prebooked and confirmed room not there Reception is eager to add costs  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Our check in was delayed 3times as the room wasn t ready the room was small and incredibly bad value for money we have stayed in many London hotels and this is by far the worst the bar was cold due to being located by the front door breakfast was farcical after queuing to get a table on the first day we had no plates out only some cold Sausages available with uncooked tomatoes and warm beans the staff seemed very disinterested in general The friends we were staying with complained and we got the grand compensation of 4 bottles of water from our mini bar reduced from our bill This experience also makes me question the value of using booking com as for over 300 per night we could have booked direct with other far better hotels  |Positive: No Positive
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Perfect location a few walking minutes away from London Eye super friendly and competent staff amazing massage good food definitely worth a stay 
Negative:  Looks like rooms are not cleaned properly We stayed for four nights On the first evening my son unpacked a book and threw packaging under the bed which I noticed later The teared packaging has not been picked up until we were leaving and I saw it and threw away Not a great evidence of cleaning service  |Positive:  Good location friendly staff 
Negative:  Overpriced hotel Rude check in staff and customer relations Long queue for breakfast area was too small for the amount of people Bar staff put in doubles when didn t ask for them so were charged twice the price Will NEVER stay here again BVooking com need to remove this hotel from their website as it is one of the worst i have ever stayed at  |Positive:  Location
Negative:  Restaurant too small for a full hotel eating breakfast We weren t prepared to wait and went elsewhere Sofa bed a little uncomfortable |Positive:  Location was great for London Eye etc Good sized room Kitchen facility and view great Staff friendly and nothing too much bother Food in the restaurant was nice when we went for dinner and waiting staff particularly good Would definitely return 
Negative:  My 4th but now final stay at the Park Plaza County Hall What has previously been a fine hotel has descended below all expectations 4 night stay in a Studio King Family with plenty of issues 1 Studio King is a lie there is no king bed and reception cheerfully laughed off my complaint on the first day that this was a mis representation 2 Lifts during high occupancy average morning wait on the first floor 10 15mins The lift simply prioritises higher floors every time Yes there are stairs but with a 7 month pregnant wife I shouldn t have to rely on them 3 Breakfast again during high occupancy a disgrace 10 15 mins average wait for a table 4 Temperature control in the room does not work bedroom was a sauna whilst living area was cool 5 Shower Water pressure poor and shower head not properly cleaned with lots of outlets blocked with scum 6 Concierge on checking out did not help with luggage from room despite request link this to pregnant wife and useless lifts after waiting 15 mins I had to carry luggage down stairs with multiple trips as my waiting airport transfer was charging for exceeding permitted waiting time 7 Lobby bar is a nice area providing good value and options of f b but suffered from being too close to the entrance and so was very cold with a constant breeze from people coming and going from the hotel All in all an absolute joke yes I understand hotels struggle during high occupancy but this was simply unacceptable at the rate charged and service expectation What was my go to Central London hotel is now a NEVER AGAIN hotel  |Positive:  Not much to like
Negative:  The windows didnt open as a result there wasnt enough fresh air into the room and all the smells were kept inside It was extremely hot and there was no way to regulate the air temperature i had to ask twice to switch the heat off at the reception The no of lifts was not enough for all the visitors nor was the no of emploees at the reseption desk Room service food was low quality and very expensive Our room wasnt cleaned every day and the sheets as well The sofa bed for the kids was not confortable we asked for a room in the upper floors with view but we got one in the 4th the hotel has 14 16 floors with no view at all  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Beds and pillows were a little hard and the glass sliding door on the toilet offered little privacy should you need it  |Positive:  hotel is in a great location for london eye and southbank rooms are well designed but bed a little hard Hotel staff set up sofa bed for our kids to share which was a nice touch Breakfast was really good too would definitely stay again 
Negative:  We had to queue for breakfast It was worth the wait but not what we expected  |Positive:  Plenty of room with seprate lounge are where the children slept The children were given money to get drinks ice cream and chocolate from the bar area 
Negative:  Most disappointed in the heating system as was unable to turn it up and as we would like to have done to complain at least until occasions we were to Cold most of the time the air conditioning unit would only blow cold and not hot  |Positive:  The mini kitchen bar
Negative:  It is difficult to work the heater in the room It was a cold week  |Positive:  We love the staff They are always kind and helpful Also we love the location We feel we can go anywhere we want in London from this location 
Negative:  Restaurant seems to be understaffed so service was quite slow Too many new employees probably due to Christmas and they could not answer to questions and provide much help  |Positive:  Good location very clean and nest facility 
Negative:  Unfortunately we did have a slight problem with the ac the thermostat would not work from the room so I had to call front desk and they would control it To be fair they did also send an electric heater to keep the room warm  |Positive:  I really liked the studio king room plenty of space for a family of four Really clean benefitting from a kitchen area with kettle microwave cups and plates etc I like the fact there was a shower and bathtub 
Negative:  Some things were in urgent need of repair and attention such as the loose fittings on the shower unit and a corner of the bathroom false wall was breaking away  |Positive:  The service was excellent The breakfast was good fresh and plentiful 
Negative:  Dining room is too small for the amount of guests we had to wait longtime before we could sit down Breakfast also needs more variaton  |Positive:  Good clean and comfortable rooms Great location 
Negative:  No kettle in the room even though there were tea making facilities I borrowed one from my daughter in the room next door  |Positive:  Good location and valet parking
Negative:  That the hotel is not the one in the photos but the one across the road with a view of a wall Not 4  |Positive:  The staff went out of their way to help by giving us an upgrade to a room with a view 
Negative:  We noticed that the front door of the hotel lets in a lot of cold air you can even feel it in the bar Other than that this hotel is perfect  |Positive:  The staff were attentive professional and so happy Especially Valentina and Atila I hope I remembered their names correctly The Christmas decorating was beautiful 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Loved this hotel great location close to the Westminster Bridge and overlooking Big Ben and the Houses of Parlament Very central location for a London base

Negative:  The suite was cold The heating was not working it could not be turned up in December  |Positive:  Excellent breakfast I was very pleased to get Eggs Bennedict Excellent Italian food for lunch Lovely suite Friendly helpful staff 
Negative:  breakfast at 19 50 was disappointing I had room service and food was cold Vegetarian sausages were just veg fingers and not appetising first thing in the morning I suggest quorn or Cauldron sausages Tomatoes not cooked and toast very pale and cold and the Danish pastry was missing Not enough milks sugars for day  |Positive:  bed was amazing great nights sleep Warm room quiet and clean Shower fab Julia at front desk was extremely helpful kind Foyer is welcoming but waiting to be seen at checking in was very hit miss hard to know where to stand 
Negative:  The room wasn t ready at check in when we really needed a rest We were given a free drink at the bar though which went some way to compensate  |Positive:  Great location spacious studio room with a fab view of the London Eye an unexpected bonus 
Negative:  Room had not been made up when we had gone out for the day even thou we told reception we were going out for the day the bath tap shot water out from the side of the filler all over the toilet seat and up the wall the plug in the sink did not work and the shower head water came out from above the shower head it self all got fixed but not the bath filler as found this out on last night taking a bath but did report it so others staying did not have the same problem as we did  |Positive:  staff happy to help very friendly 
Negative:  For a four star hotel the breakfast was not great and barely better than Premier Inn Watery egg mass produced sausages horrible coffee and fruit juice  |Positive:  Very friendly and helpful staff very comfortable and quiet room 
Negative:  We were in a studio adjacent to the atrium Whenever the elevators go up or down there s a loud clanging noise The bedroom is near the door right at the atrium It s not a continuous sound so earplugs were necessary On the second day when checking out I asked if one of the hotel staff would spend the night in our room 702 I believe so they could hear for themselves We got complimentary drinks because of our complaint but the first time we complained no action was taken With the extra topper mattress the bed was reasonably comfortable Beware of the metal leg of the sofabed when folded out  |Positive:  The staff was very friendly Cesar at the door arranged for a topper mattress for the sofabed When we got back to the room later all had been taken care of The studio had a little kitchen glasses and cups nice for making a cup of tea in the morning and for a drink at night The location was great close to the London Eye Starbucks and Waterloo Station was only a 12 minute walk 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We booked this last minute and were not disappointed Excellent location and nicely appointed rooms kids packs were a nice touch and housekeeping delivered extra conditioner within 3 minutes when requested 
Negative:  Booked a family room No a c heating working 2 small children Moved room supposedly an Upgrade same problem told by the manager it s because the room has a lot of glass Spent the night in a cold bedroom Not enough towels and poor attention to customer needs A very very disappointing stay will be writing to their head office I still had to pay  |Positive:  Good check in 
Negative:  Rainwater shower head sprayed and leaked over bathroom floor it was swimming in water and had to be mopped up with towel  |Positive:  Quiet room slept very well 
Negative:  Although it was the weekend before Christmas it was still a lot of money for the 1 night but my choice and I accept that  |Positive:  Staff are always lovely cannot do enough to help 
Negative:  The bed just not very comfortable noise in the room at night from pipe work lifts and toilet extract which was off but you could still hear it running somewhere in the building |Positive:  Smart room really nice
Negative:  Dreadful wifi connection Don t get a room on the corridor as the lifts are very noisy ask for a corner room |Positive:  Useful things in the room iron ironing board microwave kettle a whole set of crockery for 4 Hairdryer safe and fridge The most amazing view of the city especially at night Fabulous breakfast
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We visited to celebrate my mother s birthday I emailed the hotel beforehand about this and was delighted to find my mother had been upgraded to a suite with great views over Waterloo and the Shard There was also a card a bottle of red wine and some chocolates in her room to mark the occasion The reception staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful and there were plenty of staff around in the dining room at breakfast to clear tables etc The location of the hotel is excellent We caught the river boat from Westminster Pier just across the river to Greenwich which was a really relaxing way to travel Also visited the View from the Shard which is 2 tube stops away There are plenty of restaurants nearby Thank you very much to the hotel staff for a great stay 
Negative:  My only downfall is that the rooms that look inside the hotel instead of outside veiw are not the good no natural sunlight cannot feel the morning |Positive:  I liked everything how the staff are welcoming and make you feel like home with their lovely spirit i like the location the pent house is amazing
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Comfy duvet spacious studio Ideal for up to 4 adults great view of the London eye and a special message on the window written for my birthday wishes and a bottle of wine balloons Front reception staff were very welcoming and professional 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The whole place including staff were so extremely lovely and helpful and just generally amazing There isn t one thing I can say against the place Brilliant 
Negative:  Twin room but beds joined together Moved beds apart but revealed torn carpet and bare concrete Bathroom fittings loose and worn Breakfast expensive at 16 95 per person  |Positive:  Good location a neat and tidy hotel Friendly staff Room comfortable but could be much better Italian restaurant good value 
Negative:  The view from our window was over the breakfast restaurant This rendered the room windowless like a prison There was NO milk and insufficient coffee for the morning brew The mini bar was locked we clearly can t be trusted then There were so many lights one of them above the mini bar we simply couldn t find the switch for so we covered it up Breakfast was overpriced I know London is a tourist trap but a fixed cost is stupid why not charge a lower price for coffee and a croissant that is usually all most people want at that time of the morning  |Positive:  It was perfectly located in the heart of the capital Room was compact and clean 
Negative:  Absolutely nothing |Positive:  Free upgrade given to a junior suite on arrival Junior suite had all necessary facilities and more as well as amazing view of London eye from the bedroom and living area Staff could not do enough to help you Breakfast was very good and catered for all tastes 
Negative:  We have come here previously and everything was so perfect that we even decided to stay an extra night so was slightly disappointed with this experience When checking in the staff seems very stressed and busy which made us feel in the way some of the time after waiting for 5 10 minutes to talk to the receptionist we was told we had to wait until 3pm just to check in so was told to come back later so me and my 6 month pregnant girlfriend had to walk around for an hour then return just to get into the room to relax which was the purpose of the trip When we checked in I was asked if I wanted to swipe my card to be used for room service which I did but was charged 25 just for doing so When I asked about this she said it was for the extras but soon found out nothing was included Also we ordered two pizzas which turned up burnt and in the morning the full English breakfast we paid 24 for didn t even have bacon The shower door let out so much water we had to lay down towls to stop flooding In the room there are huge windows which normally would be lovely to look over London but on this occasion our view was the Waterloo train station so spend most of our trip with curtains closed Finally when we was getting ready to check out at 11 50 we had staff knocking at the door asking how long we could be then at 12 05 we had a very pushy woman asking how long we would be as well and with a pregnant woman it takes a while to do that And when it came to checking out we was waiting around 10 minutes just to do so It s very disappointing because me and my girlfriend was very much looking forward to this little get away and now I feel like iv wasted my money and should of went somewhere else I will consider returning in the future but on my trip to London it definitely won t be at this resort  |Positive:  Everything looked very nice and clean close to London Eye nice for couples
Negative:  Attitude of staff The Spa is hurrendows with only 3 lockers unisex changing facilities and sauna steam room only enough for 2 fully grown adults  |Positive:  The staff are exceedingly lazy rude Telling us that if we wanted a cup of hot water then to go to our room and boil the kettle 
Negative:  The room was cold and the A C s heating did not work Breakfast was boring and did not have anything extra only what is necessary You would expect a little more effort from a four star establishment Also breakfast was poorly coordinated and there was always a waiting before seated  |Positive:  Pillows were superb and the room was quiet Also the location in excellent 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The staff were all so friendly and helpful The room service menu was delicious with excellent range of items and speedy service The room itself was modern clean quiet and had stunning views of London 
Negative:  Queuing for breakfast is not what I like Breakfast not ready at 8 15 shouldn t be Scrambled eggs not eatable I prefer a fresh served coffee or espresso  |Positive:  One of the two beds was comfy Nice view 
Negative:  Breakfast could have been a little better quite busy had to queue but they coped well Pillows not quite to my taste but I am very fussy  |Positive:  Staff friendly and helpful nice room liked the kitchenette got upgraded to studio great location Clean 
Negative:  breakfast area was too small and very cramped had to wait 20 mins to be seated No coffee or tea brought to table No cutlery on table and had to get own ordered special breakfast waited 30 mins and then after chasing we was told not available my wife had to have no breakfast when getting breakfast from area people bumping into you and you have to wait 10 minutes for eggs and ask for bacon and beans to be topped up  |Positive:  Rooms was modern and clean 
Negative:  My stay there was fabulous and I don t have anything that I don t like  |Positive:  I liked how they took care of me I got surprised as well as they have upgraded my room to executive room with a surprise wine for my birthday That s sweet
Negative:  wi fi was rubbish I never got a stable connection at all Dreadful musak played constantly turn it off Room temperature centrally controlled so was constantly freezing It s possibly a London thing but I felt the service charging on every single thing such as the glass of wine i bought in the bar at 8 50 for 175ml became 9 28 even though my red was served in a white wine glass because the bar lady was cross I changed my mind to breakfast and dinner was excessive and frequently not warranted for the service received  |Positive:  Comfortable bed great view staff prompt with requests but not cheerful Breakfast had a wide variety cooked pastries fruit cereal toast etc Good facilities in the room coffee tea bath robe kettle crockery etc
Negative:  There was no parking available at the hotel which isn t a huge deal but having parking is always a bonus The staff was really great and helped us find a good car park about a five minute walk away The view from our room was not great we faced Waterloo Station but I m sure the other side of the hotel could see the London Eye The bar staff and the breakfast staff seemed a little preoccupied and we had some trouble flagging someone down but the drinks were good and pretty reasonable at the bar and the management was usually pretty good at noticing things and trying to adjust  |Positive:  The breakfast that was included was a full English buffet and was really good The location was absolutely fabulous close to Parliament the London Eye Westminster Abbey and Waterloo Station Not a cheap hotel but for where it is and the fact that it fit a family of four into one comfortable room a rarity in Europe the value is amazing 
Negative:  Over 50 people queuing for breakfast anticipated 30 minute wait got a refund Really not acceptable at a modern 4 star hotel Special birthday weekend spoiled ended up having breakfast in Waterloo Station  |Positive:  Reception and concierge staff very efficient and friendly Got a free room upgrade much appreciated Studio room 1108 was superb what a view Fantastic in room facilities and very comfortable 
Negative:  With only 3 lifts at certain times there is quite a long wait |Positive:  We like this hotel have stayed before and I expect we will do again The rooms are good and very well equipped
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Was Very Busy when we arrived but the staff were very friendly and dealt with us efficiently Room was clean and tidy No complaints whatsoever Great Location
Negative:  In my opinion there is no need to pay for breakfast The breakfast area is really small therefore leading to 20 40 min waits to eat We were lucky enough to be guided to a different serving area after waiting 15 min It was not worth the wait However I appreciate the kind gesture made by the staff  |Positive:  Location Location Location You can not beat this location if you are traveling with kids We were steps away from the London Eye and enough children activities to consume a full day When tired we easily walked back to the hotel The next day we were within walking distance to the waterloo train station all of the hop on hop buses stopped near by and the city buses ran through the night with stops very close to the hotel At the end of a long day it was great to lay in bed with BIg Ben and the London Eye as my view No need for an alarm clock Just look up and Big Ben was close enough to tell you the time Can t wait to stay here again 
Negative:  Very small bed Check in staff not very friendly Breakfast outrageously expensive Bar crowded and dirty  |Positive:  Location was very good Room and bathroom very clean Proper coat hangers
Negative:  The first impression on a hotel is everything and the front of house staff are first in line to do this i should know ive worked in a hotel for 6 years now and worked my way up from a receptionist to a manager looking over all departments So as soon as we walk in we immediately get what feels like from all of the concierge porters and door staff that we are not welcome all by what we are wearing i know this because everytime we walked in and out of the hotel we got glares and looked up and down and asked if anybody could help us by just stepping towards the lifts They are the first impression you make on a hotel and they destroyed this for us trust me my money is just as good as the people that are walking around in a tuxedo dont judge a book by a cover it also doesnt hurt to smile Im pretty sure thats what youre paid for Also a massive huge thank you to the gentlemen that told us not to get a taxi to the station and get the metro we had been going one way all weekend to waterloo station but he pointed us in another direction you would trust someone in a hotel to know better than you so we turned left rather than right it wasnt sign posted where we needed to go so we got lost for 15mins We finally got to the station running to catch our train from London Euston time we got there we missed our train by 4mins all thanks to a memeber of staff that cannot give directions correctly dont just point next time explain You cost me 230 to get home i sobbed on the platform station all i wanted to do is get home to my baby so thanks alot you can imagine how angry i was another member of staff not really giving a dam about us I was soo frustrated ive stopped myself writing a review for a few weeks Hope you can take this on board and learn your staff to respect and be helpful to all that stay with you  |Positive:  Loved our room it was fantastic the only thing that let it down is it was facing over a railway line and buildings so the view was a bit rubbish but that wasnt a majour issue The lady on the desk Francessca i think she was called such a lovely lady and the only staff member apart from the bar staff that genuinely made us feel welcome 
Negative:  The temperature of the water in the bathroom was luke warm  |Positive:  A lovely hotel with friendly helpful staff They went out of their way to stop a light flashing on the phone beside the bed which would have lit up the room every minute otherwise 
Negative:  I was disappointed with the view all the pictures on the website seemed to show river views We were overlooking a rather busy Waterloo Station  |Positive:  The room was perfect good facilities just right amount of space for a family of 4 Lovely and clean and comfy beds too 
Negative:  We checked in early at 10 45 ish and was told to return after 2 pm to get our room key we left our bags and returned about 5pm after a busy day and was told they were still working in our room and it would be another 10 minutes We complained as we had to be out at 6 and they gave us another room but we thought this was really poor  |Positive:  Really comfy bed room was lovely view rubbish but very quiet so we all slept well 
Negative:  I paid the Room Service bill before I actually was given the bill and there was a donation on the bill that would have been nice to have been asked if we wanted to contribute 1 00 I run a cleaning company and overall the place was very clean however was not dusty in the rooms and the mirrors were smeary The taps need descaling but this is me being picky given my profession I know how tight turnaround is There was only one T bag between three people and the room was kitted out for two people even though three were stopping so two glasses two cups two biscuits etc The cleaners were also trying to enter the room at 9 30 and out check out was 12 We inadvertently left our luggage at the wrong Plaza there was no offer to collect which was our mistake but the reception lady said we could ask but the answer would be no Make sure you get the right hotel  |Positive:  The staff were very friendly and room service was very good even though we couldn t eat everything Overall a very nice hotel with excellent views and the price is justified and having been ill for a long time this was a welcome relief and fantastic time was had by all We stopped in a Exc Suite with a City View we woke up to views of The Shard very well worth the money I m glad I paid a bit more but as three of us were travelling splitting this down meant we each paid 80 for one night 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Hotel is very central We had a room with a view of Big Ben and the London Eye Lovely bar area and decent food We went for our anniversary and the staff made a real fuss of us they d left us a bottle of wine and a card in the room when we arrived

Negative:  I wasn t to please that I was expected to pay an extra 5 to watch a movie |Positive:  I was really pleased with the service the staff were really friendly I also wasn t expecting such a massive room
Negative:  The air extractor in the Bathroom ran all night I couldn t sleep past 06 00 The shower fittings fell apart When we reported this at check out we felt no one really cared We too had an overlong wait for breakfast  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Staff were disinterested and not helpful except the porters who were most excellent The room was cold and there is nothing in the room to control this Bathrobes were very well worn and tired  |Positive:  The bed was very comfortable the room was quiet and breakfast was available nice and early Spacious room and good facilities kettle fridge even a microwave and crockery 
Negative:  N A |Positive:  Loved the location Staff were excellent proffessioal yet very friendly Would especially like to thank Anna at reception for organising a little something special for my husbands 40th Made our weekend Thank you 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  This location is excellent for families and travel It was very easy to get on the Underground as well as walk right across Westminster Bridge and to all the sights The food was excellent The wait staff was very attentive both for breakfast and for dinner 
Negative:  the fact our stay was quite expensive compared to similar hotels we have stayed in in London and didn t include breakfast It would have been nice to have been checked in by a smiling receptionist making us as guests to feel welcome and special |Positive:  loved the d cor cleanliness and ambience
Negative:  Bigger breakfast area could be an improvement but a bit of a wait and sitting very close to other tables still didn t take away from the beautiful breakfast Delicious  |Positive:  Hotel staff location and breakfast all fantastic Thank you park plaza for a wonderful stay I m very fussy when staying in hotels and this hotel didn t let me down on anything Really quiet in the bedroom and a wide range of different clients who all apprared comfortable Will definitely use this hotel again 
Negative:  Optional service charge which Is added automatically on room service as well as a tray charge Double recovery not what I would expect |Positive:  Staff very friendly
Negative:  Staff gave directions to Battersea which took us on 2 tubes and a taxi costing us approx 25 and took us an hour making us late When we went to come back we discovered it was a train directly to Waterloo costing 5 and took 15 minutes Not impressed with poor advice  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Overall very happy with the Room just the Bathroom fittings were tarnished  |Positive:  Used it as a Crash pad for a night while on business Front of House was efficient and helpful Twin room slept well room felt modern and well equiped Room was quiet with window internal to hotel Courtyard 
Negative:  I am not sure I got the room i booked as it seemed quite small for a superior double room As it was only a couple of nights however I dealt with it Being woken at 9am on the day of check out while the do not disturb sign was on the door too wasnt great Not usually this disappointed |Positive:  I love to stay at this hotel Staff know me now and are always polite
Negative:  Nothing to improve |Positive:  Fabulous room with a view of the London Eye Room and bathroom very spacious with everything we needed Given a gift of a bottle of wine as it was a special occasion collecting an award Breakfast was plentiful and excellent quality Staff especially Magda were lovely and attentive Highly recommended and will visit again 
Negative:  Inside facing room was a bit claustrophobic as could not open curtains Rubber undersheet on bed took off with difficulty Room not serviced one of the two nights Had to contact housekeeping who put it right  |Positive:  Spacious room good facilities and excellent bed 
Negative:  We had to ask for a fourth towel despite there being 4 on the booking Also had to ask for more tea bags and milk in order to make one evening drink and one in the morning  |Positive:  Very helpful polite and friendly staff Was my husband s birthday so they left a card wine soft drinks and popcorn for the children 
Negative:  The bathroom was awful there was a shower a bath and a hose and you got absolutely soaked trying to select the right one something needs to be done about that Also the sink tap was loose and rattled around in its socket and the bath when you sat in it was really difficult to get out of as it was lower than the floor level and you needed a step ladder to get out Also the photo bears no resemblance in any way shape or from to the room I was given no superior twin beds just two ordinary single beds with no gap between them at all I wont be going back there anytime soon |Positive:  Location was perfect 
Negative:  Having to que for breakfast I have never had to experience this before and won t stay here again for this reason  |Positive:  The rooms are nice with good views up high
Negative:  Understandably the hotel had over 400 rooms that needed cleaning however we were told 5 minutes and the room was much longer than 5 minutes however that being said the room was great and the view was fantastic |Positive:  The room wasn t ready so free drinks voucher were given and you could leave you luggage once you d checked out 
Negative:  Went to Marriott County Hall by mistake having known County Hall before it became a hotel Park Plaza County Hall is not at the old County Hall although it is nearby I think it confusing to have a Marriott County Hall and a Park Plaza County Hall close together although a traveller without prior knowledge would probably read the website more carefully than I did  |Positive:  We were upgraded to a Penthouse Suite very swish would like to have had more time to enjoy the comfort
Negative:  Seems to be good value for money but consider you will have to queue for 20 before to get acc s to the breakfast room never experienced this before Just consider also that you will have to wait circa 7 8 every time you want take the lift Basically overcrowded for the facilities offered Management not present never  |Positive:  Noiseless location
Negative:  I was not very pleased with my stay with park plaza so i took time to respond on this rating i can probably say about 2 3 unlikely to return on this hotel All the while i thought i could experience 5 star experience it was not I was totally disappointed how dirty my room was in fact the cobwebs at the upper lampshade was still there if you look at the left side of the bedroom the carpet was very dirty the room was over decorated at its size very way off on all the 5 star hotels i been through for a 270 a night stay its very unsatisfactory and lastly the buffet was not even close to the top hotels nearby |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Terrible service when the room filled with water from shower 5 people came after 3 calls not to clean but with us inside the room trying to close even beds with our clothes on them to get access to the floor tubes So 3 of us and 5 of them in a small room without even asking if they can do it just an hour before we check out Getting ready for our bussiness meeting Breakfast small with a tiny cooridords between tables Not worthy  |Positive:  Actually not a single thing 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The staff were extremely helpful and cheerful from the moment we arrived and were helped with our luggage which was even taken to our room while we checked in 
Negative:  We had flood every time we showered as shower head too strong for limited space in Bath and ill fitting screen No biscuits or hot chocolate in room and only one flannel left for two of us Also only one chair to sit on and we are two  |Positive:  Location great and staff friendly and helpful 
Negative:  We had an issue with sofa bed in the room we were in It was broken in the centre prior to our arrival However once we informed the staff we were accommodated in another room fairly swiftly compensated for out trouble |Positive:  Staff were friendly efficient helpful
Negative:  The room was dirty dark without view even from the 8th floor The service was slow We asked for an adaptor and we received one two days later Every day during our four night stay we had to queue for breakfast for half an hour The breakfast room was small and we had to wait for the other residents to finish We requested a late check out before arrival as booking com gave us this option We did not receive any reply When we asked at the reception desk we were told that there was no availability unless we paid another 10 pounds per hour It seems that if you pay there is availability if you don t pay the hotel is fully booked  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  While it was a great idea to have guests decide whether or not to have room cleaned we would have had to give note stating this to reception by 9am I did not even read it until 10AM Why not let it be signed and left in the room or hung outside the door just a thought |Positive:  The pillowsand duvets were perfect
Negative:  My only complaints are that the tv in the bedroom area was to the side and it made it hard for us both to see well The sheets seemed too small or were put on wrong and we had to rearrange them And we didn t get enough towels for the whole family We were usually in a hurry to make it to breakfast before the crowd so one child alternated shower days anyway Also extra pillows would have been nice too The kids never complained about the sofa bed  |Positive:  The room was very nice but not much space around beds to move around with four in the room We had a fantastic view of the the London eye but not much of the city from the 6th floor The staff were very friendly and helpful A great hotel that treated children warmly as guests It was very crowded in the breakfast area and they opened up the bar area to serve as many guests as they could The mini bar area with extra sink was very nice as was the very clean bathroom with a defogging mirror 
Negative:  Didn t like the sofa in the lounge didn t like the little tv didn t like scaley kettle for the amount I spent expected a little bit more than a sachet of coffiee |Positive:  I liked the location the bed was comftable
Negative:  Room size is small and dated decor no privacy in the toilet as its separated via a glass door Bed size is small Queuing atleast 20 30 mins for breakfast Not good at all  |Positive:  Location is great close to the main attractions e g london eye etc 
Negative:  The rooms are situated near kitchen which is very noisy We had to be asked to move in the middle of night because of this They did move us but the inconvenience of this was very tiring and due to this would not stay again  |Positive:  The location
Negative:  I paid extra for a city view but your over looking the train station and builders working |Positive:  It was in a good location with a easy easy reach of the train Station 
Negative:  The room cleaning wasn t as expected Should take care of their staff and follow up on their work  |Positive:  The room has a great view London eye very good space nice bath large TV in the living room medium one in the bed room and very useful kitchen kit Small but very beneficial 
Negative:  We did not stay long enough |Positive:  Nice room overlooking the London Eye Handy little kitchen Nice size shower Food tasted great Activities organized by the staff for children over the week end Security guards watching the entrance and requesting to show room cards to take the lift 
Negative:  When i collected my small lovely coral coloured suitcase from the concierge before leaving it was really grubby and dented  |Positive:  I had booked a suite and requested a room with a nice view as the trip was for my boyfriends birthday and got a fabulous big suite with AMAZING views of the London Eye Big Ben The Houses of Parliament And also they provided a complimentary bottle of red wine and a card which was a lovely touch Bathroom was lovely with a great large walk in shower The hotel bar was also great which serves food until late if you fancy a late bite with a few drinks Breakfast was also great with a lovely variety of dishes and a perfect start to 3 busy days Definitely would stay here again as it made the mini break extra special 
Negative:  I hated that the bathroom didn t have a real door It was only separated by a sliding partition that didn t offer much privacy The checking in and out process was not smooth Room was not ready when I was told and had to come back a couple of times before it was ready When I checked out I was given somebody else s bill I did not feel that the accommodations equaled the price I was charged  |Positive:  The staff was very accommodating and tried to help make my stay pleasant 
Negative:  Claustrophobic common areas and mediocre breakfast If you stay here choose a room only rate and go out for all meals there s plenty of choice nearby  |Positive:  Great views from our Penthouse which had a separate living room and wrap around balcony Easy walk to the Southbank and across the river on a choice of three bridges 
Negative:  Staff are too stressed may be they are under staffed Never seen so furustrated receptionist like this before We waited an exctra time to get the room which was not ready After a long journey we needed to change and kick off for a prebooked activity The delay did not help I did not expect this from such a big and pricy hotel Yet the staff were a smiley as they could be Not entirely bad  |Positive:  I stayed with my wife and 3 kids in an excutive suite The hotel is in a great location near London s famous attractions Very clean and modern Also food was very nice and the room was very well designed 
Negative:  Sofa bed very very uncomfortable even for the children to sleep on Requested an extra duvet to put as additional mattress to try and make a little more comfortable  |Positive:  Room was very clean and the sofa bed made up on arrival Very pleasant front of house staff allowed us to store our bags until we could check in as we were early Requested extra duvet and pillows no problem Liked the monopoly money the children could exchange for items nice touch 
Negative:  You have to wait a lot of time to have breakfast it seems the area for the breakfast was too small for the capacity of the people they sleep in this hotel There was a lot of dust in the room and especially behind the TV set The bath towels seem to be very old almost becoming gray from white Too expensive |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Beds could have been more comfy  |Positive:  Stayed in a family suite during half term perfect as the two areas meant we were separated from our kids by the bathroom Great view of the County Hall and London Eye Staff very friendly and welcoming Location is just fantastic and the breakfast was fab too 
Negative:  Sofa bed in family room was a bit lumpy and bumpy  |Positive:  Family room was brilliant small kitchenette with microwave 4 x plates bowls cutlery mugs Tiny fridge but enough for mlk and a few supplies Perfect for making snacks for the children Sound proofing excellent 
Negative:  Room was nice and contemporary the bathroom sliding glass door is not practical makes too much noise when opening and closing especially in the middle of the night when others are sleeping AND it is far from sound proof when showering and getting ready while others are still sleeping  |Positive:  We arrived at 8 30am and the staff offered us an option for a room right away which was reasonable and allowed us to clean up before hitting the sights in London Great Although the view was far from good it didn t matter to us since we were leaving however NOT sure they should have charged us extra given the view I think if you are going to charge an extra 30 pounds for early access then for the money something should be provided like a view But we greatly appreciated having a room to store our stuff and clean up after such a long flight from US 
Negative:  The room was too hot despite turning the air con as low as it could go You need persistence to get room service to answer your call  |Positive:  Courtney on the front desk was excellent The rooms were very well furnished big and clean The shower was superb A kitchen area was a welcome plus The hotel catered for food allergies The hotel was close to Waterloo station near Westminster Bridge and the London Eye London Dungeons Sea Life

Negative:  We spent over 10 minutes waiting for an elevator the day we were checking out They definitely need more elevators  |Positive:  This was our second time staying at this hotel and we love it It s so central with a great family room set up And the view of the Eye always makes me happy This time there was a mistake on a room service food order but it was quickly remedied and the charge removed

Negative:  Room view had windows that don t open as the view is within looking over the restraunts very unusual and no Fresh air |Positive:  Hotel was nice room was terrible

Negative:  The room was small and hot and the a c was noisy and ineffective Little space to relax certainly not possible to enjoy a comfortable breakfast We should have booked the Park Plaza Westminster Bridge which has a better atmosphere |Positive:  The location
Negative:  Room size for single occupancy was just too tiny I could hardly fit in 2 bags no view atall Tv channels were vintage too with no music channel even a basic movie channel and all was paid  |Positive:  The bed was comfy breakfast buffet was good enough and location was close to Westminster which is tourist hub 
Negative:  It took ages for us to be able to check out The staff at the checkout desk were oblivious to which customers were next in the queue due to there not being a queue system set up My husband I were waiting patiently for a long time for the 2 or 3 staff members to serve their customers when a rude man another customer went in front of us soon as a staff member was free she didn t say anything like Sorry these customers were in front of you so we had to wait another half an hour It was far too slow  |Positive:  We loved the size of the bedroom the bathroom was also lovely Great roomy shower too 
Negative:  Nothing to complain about |Positive:  Great location and value for money Stayed her for our anniversary visit to the big smoke When arrived discovered there was a bottle of wine in the room as well as petals on the bed which made our 25th Anniversary even more special
Negative:  The room is kimd of narrow so there is limited space to put 3 luggage in and able to fully open them  |Positive:  I like that the room has a small kitchen in it very convenient Staffs especially concierges are very helpful Great location near everything 
Negative:  It was needed to ask for 2 hours late checkout I was unwell and outside was a heavy rain weather I thought that they will contact with me to confirm or reject my request I spent a lot of money during my stay I was just asking for 2 hours for free The staff did not call me I thought that they are accepting my request In fact they by themselves cut the money and took some extra money as donation from my accounts with unauthorised way which were impolite and very bad behaviours I was perhaps going to cancel my request or extend one night instead of cut more money for just 2 hours It looked like stolen issue therefore I really would like to refund my money The supervisor did not care I confirmed to her that I will complain she was laughing and showed me her name on her T shirt as a kind of the confrontation  |Positive:  the location was good 
Negative:  Stayed in an accessible family room my husband and I had to sleep on the sofa bed mattress extremely thin and uncomfortable this was really disappointing and effected our impression of the hotel room overall We expected much better quality for the price charged  |Positive:  Very nice hotel in a great location very clean staff very pleasant

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Excellent property no matter what the reason your stay in London If you wanted to be close to many of the tourist sites this is the place The life of the city This is the place And in walking distance 
Negative:  I have stayed several times at Park Plaza hotels in this exact area their are three within several hundred feet This being my first time at Park Plaza Country Hall I expected the same gold standard that I have experienced at the other hotels I was staying in the Penthouse on the top floor for the weekend which means I expect Penthouse level customer service I had several issues with house cleaning security and most significant of all was the decor in the Penthouse The Penthouse has an amazing view of Big Ben Parliament and London Eye The decor is staggeringly outdated and resembles a 70 s era theme room which is not what I believe they purposely set out to do All of this really soured my experience at a hotel chain that I exclusively choose to utilize when I am in London This experience may deter me from using this specific hotel during any future trips to London That being said I reached out to Hotel Management about my experience and they showed great concern which is in the what did you like section please read  |Positive:  Hotel Management promptly reached out to me after reaching out to them to voice my concerns with my Park Plaza experience They were apologetic and quickly spoke to the departments that I had experienced sub par hotel service to try and address any issues Hotel Management also was very generous in their offer for compensation to compensate for my poor experience even though I declined any compensation I was very pleased with their desire to correct my issues to be consistent with standard Park Plaza experiences After speaking with Hotel Management I feel more comfortable with the possibility of returning to Park Plaza 
Negative:  Can t think of anything we didn t like  |Positive:  Helpful staff very comfortable bed excellent food in the restaurant and very quiet given the location 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The location was the main reason for the choice of this hotel close to all the activities we had planned and choice of parking Room facilities were great didn t eat so can t comment front desk staff housekeepers were all excellent 
Negative:  Requested a quiet room in advance and this was confirmed at reception unfortunately our room was on a gallery and overlooked the lift area from which banging occurred at night and day but not so noticeable then The noise seemed to be produced by the counter weights on the glass fronted lifts Apart from this very annoying interruption to our sleep everything else was good Have stayed here previously but not in this area of the hotel  |Positive:  Nearly everything 
Negative:  Nothing an ideal venue for our visit  |Positive:  Great location close to Waterloo and then an easy and comfortable walk via Westminster Whitehall to the West End very enjoyable 
Negative:  There was nothing I could complain about |Positive:  The staff were extremely helpful they upgraded my room for free which had the view of the London eye they also left a bottle of wine and a birthday card for my partner The room was luxurious and had lovely elemis shower gels and body lotions in the bathroom I had an amazing stay and would definitely book there again
Negative:  Every time you enter the hotel you have to show your key to make sure you are a resident of the hotel but they need to fix their attitude while asking instead making you feel as you are a intruder want to enter the hotel In addition time of check out they staff didn t help in taking the luggage from the reception to the car they asked me to ask the driver and that it s not their job to do so this single incident made me think twice to come back to this hotel or not Other than that everything was good |Positive:  The whole experiance that I don t need to interact with the staff
Negative:  everything was great we had a fantastic time  |Positive:  The breakfast was the hit very nice and worthwhile and the Italian Restaurant is worth a try The beds and room we very comfortable and had a lot of space in for two People room no 723 We slept very well no noise from outside traffic Very pleasant place to stay with Family and tube Station very Close Very helpfull and friendly staff 
Negative:  Reception was a not efficient I tried to pay for the length of my stay upon checking in but the reception was adamant that I pay the first night I told her that it was better if I do only one transaction on my card but she won t have any of it but after we have done the transaction on the card she asked me if I want to pay the rest of my stay So I thought that was really bizarre She wasn t friendly at all and just get on with what she was doing Came down the following day to pay for the rest of my stay and no greetings only after the transaction she remembered that she ought to ask if my stay was so far any good  |Positive:  Location is great
Negative:  Reservation process for family was a mess Moved to a room in front of the elevators Breakfast was always full and had a long waiting queue to get a table  |Positive:  Location is superb
Negative:  The breakfast was on the expensive side for what you get  |Positive:  The location was perfect within walking distance of the London Eye Westminster Abbey Big Ben and the Thame River There are many cute restaurants close by 
Negative:  Eggs at breakfast tasted like powdered eggs and the mushrooms were tinned  |Positive:  Staff went above and beyond what was expected The situation of the Hotel was very central both to attractions and transport The Italian restaurant food was delicious 
Negative:  The breakfast could have been priced lower It was a little on the expensive side  |Positive:  There was a small microwave sink dishes and refrigerator in the room
Negative:  The bathroom shower drain produced random flapping noises through the night room 518 The bathroom was grubby around the corners of the shower and floor The air con was noisy and the room was very stuffy with it off Because we paid by debit card the room fridge was locked so any milk we brought to the room could not be kept cold Very limited clothing stowage no draws of any good size the hanging space was limited due to the ironing board spare quilts and pillows OK once they were taken out The safe was just above floor level so on your hands and knees to open it and lock it  |Positive:  The bed was excellent as was the Italian restaurant 
Negative:  100pounds were charged in case of extras at the moment of checking in and I do not remember having been properly informed  |Positive:  Comfortable room big clean and equipped with basics for a quick dinner if not wanting to go outside

Negative:  This hotel does not have parking bay and it makes it difficult to get dropped off or take a taxi We stayed in a family studio and found a sofabed too soft The rooms at Park Plaza Westminster Bridge opposite were more spacious and more comfortable  |Positive:  Location is excellent 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Room extremely small so upgraded then upgraded again because we were so disappointed So the money we did end up spending could have been spent on a much nicer hotel Room was freezing cold and took a very long time to heat up Room felt commercial and not what expected Bed was small always looked forward to the big bed in lovely hotels but not this one Sorry but I wouldn t recommend On the plus side the view was good 
Negative:  There was nothing to dislike  |Positive:  Room size was excellent Upgraded to the City view Worth every penny to see the sun coming up over London Will definitely return Check in was seamless although many people checking out Dealt with straight away 
Negative:  Only down side was our view from the room as we was looking out over the old euro tunnel station But nothing the hotel could do about this and didn t want to move room as our room 504 was really nice  |Positive:  Nice hotel very clean and staff friendly plenty of choice for breakfast Attractions are within walking distance and if you did need to get a taxi the park plaza opposite has a taxi rank with plenty of taxis waiting our hotel room had a kitchenette with microwave which was great as we have a toddler so was easy to warm her food and milk for the evening Overall our stay was very pleasant and we would recommend 
Negative:  We had to call housekeeping due to stain covered bedsheets for sofa bed which stank took half an hour before anybody came and replaced didn t help put new sheets on Kids were shattered so didn t help matters Staff seemed unhelpful was this due to Not wanting extras  |Positive:  Great location
Negative:  room good have been a bit bigger breakfast room a bit crowded on weekends |Positive:  very friendly and cooperative staff very good breakfast nice bar nice room located very closely to Waterloo Station Big Ben Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace

Negative:  Would have liked breakfast to be included in our room price or at least be a little cheaper  |Positive:  Very friendly staff and family friendly as described Lovely room with view of the London Eye Nice restaurant Location is great ideal for exploring the sights of Westminster the South Bank beyond and easy access to other areas 
Negative:  No fresh air No ability to open any kind of window It was very warm on our stay and it felt claustrophobic I appreciate we were on a high floor but maybe a smaller window that would allow some fresh air in would have been good  |Positive:  Location and views could not be beaten
Negative:  The cooked breakfast wasn t as good as I expected the eggs didn t taste like eggs and the mushrooms should always be fresh and not tinned The toast machine wasn t working either  |Positive:  The rooms were very nice and the bed was very comfy The kitchen facilities in the room were an added bonus 
Negative:  As above but rest OK Room small but it is in Central London |Positive:  The breakfast layout was shambolic The food under cooked meat Staff wandering around not knowing what to do All in all breakfast experience very poor 
Negative:  I never get a respond to my email asking for early check in which they didn t accept at the hotel which ruined my first day in London after such a long flight the WIFI is very bad you barely can browse or send text messages  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Elevators were kind of small and slow and for some reason many people were riding them up and back down again for no apparent reason they are glass but the view is only the inside atrium making them crowded  |Positive:  Great location and views Kind of a roundabout walk to get into Waterloo station but very easy to walk to Queens Walk and cross over the Thames to Westminster

Negative:  Bathroom let the suite down as it didn t look up to standard compared to the rest of the suite taps and shower looked as if it needed cleaning with a goodlime scale remover  |Positive:  The suite was excellent for our short stay with family and staff were very helpful and friendly Hotel was in an excellent location and hotel facilities were good 
Negative:  There was nothing i didnt like about the hotel But maybe instead of red wine maybe a bottle of schloer or some other sparkling grape juice But i didnt mind becaus ei know i didnt put that in my notes so staff would not of known but again no complaints i was just as happy with that thought  |Positive:  The buffet breakfast was had evrything in hand was well catered for has nothing went empty even the orange juice was well topped as i was drinking faster than water I was also offered veg sausages which was a surprise very tasty When i checked abit on the 1st night at 1am staff were helpful in giving a short car park space to allow my sleeping kids out of the car into my room my buggy luggage were taken up to the room after a speedy check in service allowing me to then go find my booked car park at briannia Also prehand i was emailed the room might not be big enough for my kids allowing me to find a quick cheap upgrade to a bigger room my other questions were answered just as quickly I told the hotel it my 10th anniversery in my extra comments when booking so staff can congtraulate my wife when we checked in or maybe at later stage they did one better by leaving a nice surprise im hotel room with a nice bottle of wine some fancy luxury popcorn strawberry cream flav for her belgian choc for me Very nice But we dont dont drink alchol but i was well impressed with the thought effort put in the welcoming Top marks Also on the 1st moring when we were planning our day out on sat moring on our way we forgot about the fresh milk to give to my 2 year daughter but the lady bartender saved the day in helping getting us some warm milk With no charge Thanks

Negative:  Didn t get into room until 3pm and that was only because of me complaining dirty sheets no toilet roll asked for more when came back just thrown in bathroom this is just half of it |Positive:  Good location
Negative:  For the cost the rooms are small compared to North America But bigger here than what you will find at hotels elsewhere Staff were exceptional  |Positive:  The location was key close to the London Eye a block away and half a block to WESTMINISTER Bridge where you can walk across to Big Ben You can also catch all the tour buses there which for seeing London are a good bang for your pound

Negative:  We were put in a room at the back of the hotel overlooking the train station just near the cleaning room which we heard a slamming door all night We changed room with an upgrade which was still at the back of the hotel and same room Our friend checked in the same night and asked for an upgrade at check in and she got the best view  |Positive:  The location was amazing We weren t too sure how far it would be away from everything considering it was over the river Not at all superior location and only a 5 min walk over the bridge Amazing hotel for families They are extremely accommodating to kids 
Negative:  We shared a room with my brother who was visiting and the hotel provided a pull out sofa bed That was fine Unfortunately the pullout bed was near the window and the regular bed was nearest the door My wife and I slept on the pullout bed just because of the access to windows and natural light I thought that the main bed should be closest to the window instead of the sitting area pullout bed Seemed like a bad layout plan The pullout bed was tolerable but we cannot comment on the main bed because we didn t sleep on it  |Positive:  Staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the day and night Very close to the London Eye

Negative:  The breakfast was not good Taking a run of the mill buffet breakfast and turning in to something special is not complicated and creates a memorable moment that the hotel could be famous for At the moment processed scrabbled eggs cardboard bacon and over baked rolls are not the way forward Unfortunately the pineapple juice had turned and was undrinakable having said all of that the staff were nice  |Positive:  Location room and staff Better facilities the a premier inn and well apportioned rooms 
Negative:  Breakfast was chaotic queues very long waited over half an hour one of the days were we there restaurant area is cramped and people are seated too close to each other so no privacy for a conversation No where to sit in the reception area Not exactly wheelchair accessible Photos are deceptive as the hotel isn t as close to the London Eye as the photos make out  |Positive:  The beds were comfy Facilities in the room were good Room service was excellent very delicious and quick Central location

Negative:  Our view was just another hotel across the street Careful when booking the photos seem to give the impression it is the hotel at the end of Westminster bridge but that another from the same company Can sometimes be a 5 10 minute wait for breakfast table as dining area is too small for such a large hotel  |Positive:  Clean friendly and a high standard in the room Bed was very comfy food tasted great even the buffet breakfast

Negative:  Attitude of some of the reception staff particularly at check in Studio was smaller that I expected It came with a kitchenette but it was a squeeze to make a cup of coffee Also fridge space could just about accommodate a 2 litre milk bottle Not enough toiletries provided for a family of four Two tellies provided but acoustics made it impossible to use both at the same time There seemed to be a time lag and echo between the two sets Had to wait ages for sofa bed to be made up on the Friday and Saturday night Not good when trying to maintain a routine for young kids Steam room and sauna area needs to be cleaned more regularly Lots of hair lying about and robes were tiny Also black algae in our shower surround Had to repeatedly get key card reactivated Room was showing signs of wear and tear Faucet tap was loose Mirror was cracked Worst of all was the stench from the drains This was stifling some times usually at night  |Positive:  Location close to Westminster Bridge Soundproof completely missed the storm on Sunday night Housekeeping left a nice message and some sweets for the kids on Day 1 Ice making machine on our floor Swift action taken to rectify faulty faucet when the problem was reported to the front desk Relieved to be able to block authorization of purchases from exorbitant minibar Tiny serving of jelly beans was 4 Terribly tempting for little hands Express checkout

Negative:  I stayed in room 621 at checkout reception didn t ask if I had a good stay and I forgot to mention my complaint as I was in a hurry heading off for a meeting room 621 has an adjoining door the noise from the next room into mine was ridiculous the door may as well have been left open I enjoyed multiple different people staying in the room next to me think 622 over course of my stay and was continually awoken at times ranging from midnight to 2 30am in the morning I don t think they realised how think the space was between the adjoining doors this would put me off staying again at this hotel |Positive:  Nice breakfast large room good location for tubes sights etc
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  everything was very close few minutes walking and you were in the middle of everything the staff were very kind they would not let you go out in the rain without an umbrella was very clean room was huge beds super comfy food on point the doormen were very friendly and made you fell welcome was like a home away from home would highly recommend to everyone AMAZBALLS xoxo gossip girl

Negative:  Personally we found the room rather claustrophobic difficult to explain the layout as the outside of the room was actually inside the building so had no view or natural daylight which was quite confusing at 2 45 this morning when I happened to wake Just felt like we state of semi darkness the whole time we spent in the room Fine for one night but had we have had a longer stay I would have to have asked if they had an outward facing room I don t like to sound like a cheapstake but breakfast was 18 each we opted to take a 5 minute walk around the corner and found a small decent caf and had a very adequate breakfast for 5 each |Positive:  Well located and on the Eye side of the City Was as expected for a reasonably priced City Hotel Rooms clean and comfortable Beds very comfortable with cosy feather pillows and duvets Microwave and crockery in the room if you wanted to do some sort of mini self catering

Negative:  A bit chilly in the main areas because open plan is contiguous with the front doors to the hotel  |Positive:  Very nice locale Well equipped comfortable but not spacious fitness center Very convenient to Waterloo station which connects to central London well Went for larger room which had nice sitting area and worth the extra price

Negative:  Rubbishy A C we stayed in winter and were rather uncomfortably warm I would say that the system could do with an overhaul prior to hotter months Appreciate that lower Windows cannot be opened due to height of hotel and local noise traffic etc however there were no risk upper Windows that might have that facility if a c is an issue |Positive:  Location suite upgrade great staff and ease of check in
Negative:  Not a bad experience at all just a minor quibble Please replace tinned orange segments with real orange slices grapefruit at breakfast Also suggest replacing mackerel with smoked salmon  |Positive:  Great location Nice restaurant Very comfy beds Liked the ice maker on every floor Really handy little kitchenette in the room Good sound and light proofing Great view over London

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We stayed here on our wedding night and the staff were incredible They treated us with such warmth and really made it feel special The room was wonderful and the breakfast delicious What really made it were the staff who were incredible Recommended 
Negative:  The shower cubicle in the bathroom was very small for this rating of hotel don t drop anything The great water pressure made up for the lack of space in shower though  |Positive:  The hotel is very conveniently located to the theatres and covent garden The room was well insulated and the bed was very comfy so much so I slept through a thunder storm 
Negative:  Tea and coffee facilities should be in the room although you could phone reception and ask for them I feel they should have been there without asking the room could have been bigger |Positive:  The staff were so welcoming and the little touches in our room like the rose petals and electric candles by our bath made our stay extra special the pillows were a dream to sleep on 
Negative:  Considering the reports and ratings that are celebrating the hotel we were slightly disappointed The furniture of the suite looked a little worn out and old fashioned You can hear the toilet flush from the adjactent floors in the bathroom All in all it doesn t feel very personal and private in the room Breakfast is terribly over priced a usual thing in a lot of hotels to be honest and not worth writing home about Would definetly choose another hotel in London next time  |Positive:  First thing we got an upgrade from a room to a suite which was very nice Staff was helpful Real beautiful bar with terrific looking bar menu cocktails A lot of attractions of London in walking distance 
Negative:  The really noisy flushing toilet which was like you get on an airplane and so loud I was woken by the plumbing in adjoining rooms |Positive:  Wonderful staff So switched on and so genuinely helpful and concerned about pleasing guests
Negative:  Although I have commended the breakfast it was possibly a little over the top There really was more food than anyone could sensibly require My niece had to ask for her pillows to be changed as she has an allergy to goose and duck down Replacements were provided immediately and without question but were far too big The staff s anxiety to please is perhaps a little overpowering for people like us who are not wealthy but can manage an occasional special treat  |Positive:  The staff were all very friendly and attentive The food was superb My 9 year old great nephew could barely believe the breakfast enough food to feed an army served by a waitress who deserves special commendation very professional cheerful and obliging The porters were also all very helpful The lobby bar is well worth a visit The hotel is within easy reach of many of the West End theatres and other attractions 
Negative:  I understand that room rates are high in this part of London and that One Aldwych is a very high standard hotel with 24hr room service but I felt that it wouldn t be too much to ask for tea and coffee making facilities in the room and that breakfast items were very expensive even compared to the restaurant dinner prices However the pub across the road serves an excellent breakfast at less eye watering prices  |Positive:  High level of service and comfort throughout the hotel
Negative:  Having to leave Wish we could of stayed longer  |Positive:  All staff was so helpful to make our stay a memorable one from organising a special birthday treat in the room for my daughter to personally taking us to the taxis every time we needed one The rooms beds were so comfortable with everything you need Hotel is right next to the theatre which with children is great after the evening show being able to walk back 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Great small luxury hotel Good size well equipped rooms Excellent location for central London on the strand near the Thames and close to Covent Garden Spa 
Negative:  Nothing |Positive:  Wonderful hotel in an excellent location Rooms are well furnished and comfortable with tea coffee facilities iron etc supplied on request The hotel also has a great gym and pool area The staff are without doubt some of the best we ve encountered in the hotels we ve stayed at very professional helpful and friendly Cocktails in the lobby bar are fantastic if a little pricy We dined one evening at the Eneko restaurant in the hotel basement which is very highly recommended fab food ambience 
Negative:  I think the staff were a little too suggestive in having extras but this was minor we had a fruit side plate for breakfast but didn t really need this so ended up not eating it  |Positive:  The hotel location is perfect for a weekend getaway walking around Covent Garden and getting in an evening show The hotel is very stylish The staff were extremely helpful friendly and professional The bed was very comfortable and the room temperature perfect The breakfast was delicious 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Appreciated the customer service and attention to detail with the service all staff were friendly and professional The bar very smart is a welcoming comfortable place at the end of a long day in London sightseeing celebrating especially for for a late night drink snack
Negative:  Noisy kids in pool meant I didn t go in but it was Easter so to be expected I guess  |Positive:  Gorgeous sink in pillows on the bed Door staff always friendly and welcoming Steam room super hot which was wonderful 
Negative:  Nothing to dislike the rooms are as you would expect in a 5 hotel beds comfortable bathrooms are fine  |Positive:  The location is fantastic Covent Garden literally around the corner right next door to the Lion King and Mumma Mia so slap bang in theatre land couldn t be better We went with a group of 18 to celebrate our daughter s 18th birthday From the initial booking until we left the hotel the staff could not have been more helpful We received several emails to confirm everything prior to our arrival and the reservations staff were very helpful in arranging all the necessary rooms for a complicated group The bar manager organised a private room for us to have drinks before we left for dinner we went to 100 Wardour Street which I would also recommend for dinner dancing club ideal for parties at no extra charge with a lovely waiter who looked after us perfectly The doormen were super helpful in ensuring we got all our 18 year olds into four taxis making everything run smoothly and stress free All in all One Aldwych is now our favourite London hotel and that is really down to the staff and location They also have a gluten free restaurant which is great for me and very unusual so no problems with gluten free options Thank you SO much for making our daughter s big day so lovely 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The room attendants attention to detail was excellent and we were impressed with the small touches like the fresh fruit the advisory notes left The tea tray with the fresh flowers etc 
Negative:  Room very small wardrobe access in particular small Shower access over the bath not easy for one of us being over 70 years young a room with a walk in shower is quite a bit more expensive The lounge facilities for residents is limited  |Positive:  A very warm greeting on arrival and everything very well explained All the staff were lovely and very friendly The room was well equipped and spotlessly clean very comfortable bed and pillows wonderful bathroom toiletries very good fluffy towels and a good size complementary newspaper water and tea making equipment Nice quiet room 
Negative:  Outdated room design much nicer in pictures than real life was very disappointed expected it to be nicer for a 5 star hotel Loud plumbing noises in bathroom after use of water  |Positive:  Great location and very friendly staff

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The hotel provides outstanding service and is in the heart of the theatre district and just steps from The Savoy Hotel Covent Garden Martket and a bridge to the West Bank with all its food carts Excellent restaurants surround the hotel and the hotel itself houses outstanding restaurants and a bar with novalty drinks served until midnight

Negative:  Incredibly noisy Miniscule bedroom Broken toilet Water issue Plumber finally fixed it at 2am Key for adjoining room opened ours at the same time Guided to sit infront of lift when having a drink in the bar Receptionist in the morning a complete robot Knew we d had a terribly night Instead of starting off with an apology she asked if we d had a good night I commented that there were a few issues to which she replied oh yes I heard For 350 night and 18 glass of fizz I don t expect the adjoining room to open my door have a waterfall in the middle of the night nor do I expect to relax sip champagne in front of a lift shambolic faulty towers  |Positive:  Eggs benedict breakfast was awesome Pool amazing 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  We loved the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Tea It was the perfect girl s afternoon out during a celebratory weekend The staff was incredibly helpful and made us feel very welcome The Concierge arranged for two fun tours that we thoroughly enjoyed The Lobby Bar was delightful Our room was quiet and very comfortable The location couldn t be beat with a short walk to Covent Garden the theatres the Thames and many restaurants We will definitely be back 
Negative:  The breakfast was not up to the level of the rest of the experience at this hotel Expensive and not tasty Slow service |Positive:  Location perfect Bed a dream Staff outstanding Loved the fruit cookies small cakes left in our room each night The box at the front door of the room for the papers each morning was a nice touch 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  There was special attention regards to the celebration of my husbands 35th birthday with a bottle of champagne and amazing chocolate cake in our room 
Negative:  I booked five nights and each night I was charged a different rate I booked my stay through booking com Although the booking site mentioned a daily rate I was very disappointed that at the time of check out the front desk charged me 5 different rates I wonder who s responsible for this lapse Hotel or the booking engine OTA  |Positive:  Very friendly and carering staff They make you feel like you want to come back over and over again 
Negative:  The walk in shower was pretty tiny  |Positive:  The location is perfect the staff warm friendly and accommodating The rooms are lovely with little surprises delivered daily by the staff High tea is a treat and the lobby bar is upscale and lively This is definitely my favorite UK property

Negative:  The staff were a little over attentive although very polite At lunch I felt uncomfortable as the staff were coming over what seemed like every 15mins  |Positive:  The spa and pool were lovely especially being in central London Afternoon tea Charlie and the Chocolate factory selection was delightful Size of room and bathroom were very spacious I would definitely stay again 
Negative:  Pillows were terrible a five star hotel should have a selection of pillows to choose from Our hotel room door lock was missing so it didn t feel very secure The bathroom was quite tired and old fashioned plus the pump was noisy Cocktails were expensive and although tasty lacked much alcohol The hotel bar and restaurant were not that of a five star hotel and lacked ambience The pool was average again a little tired and the health club did not feel like that of w five star hotel  |Positive:  Staff were very friendly prompt check in good turn down service etc Good location close to river and Covent Garden Our room was spacious clean and very quiet Nice touches in the room like free champagne for our anniversary Reception responded promptly to all my emails prior to arrival
Negative:  We arrived to a king bed when my girlfriend and I specifically wanted and booked twin beds The lag time in getting this handled was a bit annoying because the desk clerk did not take this seriously enough Evidently he does not travel because he was very disrespectful of our request and a bit argumentative Car to airport did not arrive Agostinho was not on duty and we waited at least 20 minutes prior to getting into a cab I personally checked on the car about 10 minutes prior to departing and he had not arrived which I found unusual for Great Britain but then at the specific time and he still was not there I felt that a call should have been made promptly rather than waiting for us to have to ask 10 minutes later Hopefully these comments can be taken in a positive way to help improve customer service for this very nice facility  |Positive:  We had the specific pleasure of having a wonderful concierge Agostinho He went out of his way to do anything he could for us He helped book and hand pick theater seats for us for 4 plays arrange a trip to the Cotswolds and just in general gave us tips on places to eat and where to go with very specific directions

Negative:  Small grumble We had the afternoon tea However there was a special reception in the lobby bar in connection with the BAFTAs so we had to eat in the general dining area I think we should have been told that when we booked Then we asked if we could chose where we sat and were told no as certain tables were reserved for regular diners No one sat at any of those tables the entire time we were there  |Positive:  For a special occasion this will always be my first choice in London Ideally placed for shows or covent garden excellent service lovely lobby bar for drinks

Negative:  From the moment you arrive reception staff are rude unfriendly and in the bar area the staff ignored us for 30 mins then when we sat at a empty reserved table as we only wanted one drink before we went to dinner we were kicked off the table in an abrupt manner we went to the bar area couldn t get served left after 20 mins table still sitting empty Will never return |Positive:  Location great for the theatre

Negative:  Staff was friendly but could be slightly more helpful when asking some directions for a good place to eat Missing a bar or place for a drink Limited shops and restaurants in the direct area unless you cross over to the High Street Champs drinks in the minibar are overpriced 6 for a simple coke but this is a more Paris issue in general perhaps  |Positive:  Clean rooms no noise even when so close to the main street excellent balcony with a super view 5th floor nicely decorated safe everything you need for a perfect stay Close to the metro station and this line brings you to all good places 
Negative:  Can t think of anything we didn t like  |Positive:  We had a beautiful room for three on the six floor with a full view of the Arc de Triumphe and a partial view of the Eiffel Tower Every detail was lovely Newly decorated I believe and tastefully done in soft colors it was a pleasure to stay at this hotel

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Could not have asked for a better and a more comfortable stay in Paris In terms of location it doesn t get any better than this If you opt for a room with a view like we did then you get a view that is the envy of all Arc De Triomphe We did not opt for breakfast in the hotel since there are numerous patisseries and cafes around Despite arriving at the hotel way before our check in time the concierge accommodated us almost immediately The rooms are large by European standards very clean and airy i m talking about the rooms with a view Friendly and courteous staff added to our stay A special mention of Mr Farukh who floored us with his hospitality and generosity of ideas Thank you Splendid Etoile you truly made our stay Splendid

Negative:  Cleaning staff changes our staff locations for example my wife arranged her makeup on the disk the moment we arrived but the cleaners take it and put it in the bathroom Very expensive compared to the service and the room and the facilities in the hotel The room was so small Very hot room there was no air conditioning in the hotel and they refused to open the A C because the manager closed it until our last night they opened it  |Positive:  Very friendly staff Location was not bad The view was great They allowed us to check in very early

Negative:  The place could do with a revamp but they don t need to try harder because they have the traffic anyway |Positive:  Friendly staff excellent location furnishings a bit aged but not below expections 
Negative:  The room was small the elevator was quaintly small and the staff s directions were correct but not always easy to follow For example they would say turn right then go until the street ended then turn right and what you wanted was right there But they wouldn t know the names of the street or tell you that right there meant cross a major street and go 1 or 2 blocks  |Positive:  The location was great and the staff was super friendly and eager to help The breakfast had more items than I expected For example I don t drink caffeinated drinks or coffee and they had a brewed herbal tea To my surprise they had both regular yogurt and Greek yogurt had a machine that squeezed fresh orange juice by the glass and there were other pleasant surprises Also our room was in the old part of the hotel and had a view of the Eiffel Tower That was a totally unexpected treat Although I also listed it in the negatives the elevator in the old part of the hotel was comically small It could barely fit 1 person I don t know how the bellman got our 2 suitcases and 2 rolling carryons into it I imagine he put them in the elevator pressed the floor button and raced it to our floor 4th 
Negative:  Nothing  |Positive:  Location was just excellent Staff were very friendly rooms a little on the small side but this is to be expected for Paris really Very very good hotel would definitely stay there if visiting Paris again 
Negative:  Not really a restaurant or bar but opposite the hotel there is a fantastic wine bar and there are plenty of restaurants in the area to explore  |Positive:  Fantastic hotel near the Sorbonne on the Paris left bank Close to many restaurants and bars but outside the tourist zone Our room was a decent size and very comfortable The hotel has character but has been refurbished and tastefully decorated Our room faced the street but at night it was quiet There are always refreshments in reception and very friendly staff 
Negative:  The elevator is small  |Positive:  The environment around is great A V lib station is in front of the hotel It takes about 30 minutes to go to Cath drale Norte Dame de Paris by walking There are some Asian style restaurants around the corner for people miss Udon with hot soups 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Nice room very quiet in the night the bed was comfortable we particularily liked the bath tub and the small refrigerator The breakfast buffet was good The cold juice and water offered free of charge in the early afternoon was nice My daughter especially liked the PC and the candies in the reception area 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The location is very convenient but quiet My husband and I were traveling with our adult daughter and were able to book a connecting room for her She had a completely separate room but we did not have to pay double the price of one room The rooms were large by European standards 
Negative:  Elevator could be bigger but that s only because the age of the building We managed ok  |Positive:  Wonderful staffs beautiful breakfast room and foods elegantly displayed and served Gracious hospitality overall Convenient location for public transportation 
Negative:  The housekeeping was a little flaky Face towel disappeared and never returned Milk wasn t topped up Room was small but Parisian hotels usually are Double glazing would be good despite being on 7th floor there was noticeable street noise We had a really good deal on the price I do not know if I would have been so happy paying full price  |Positive:  Excellent location and comfortable hotel Very pleasant staff 5 6 minutes walk to Isle de la Cite and about 6 7 walk to the metro Plenty of nice cafes and restaurants nearby
Negative:  I really don t understand how this hotel has a four star rating My room was very small super dark and it wasn t the cleanest hotel room I saw No drinking water in the room or fridge Staff is not at all friendly or hospitable they asked me to pay the day BEFORE my check out like I was a thief or something similar and I felt very uncomfortable about this I travel for work every week and I have visited hundreds of hotels and honestly this was the first time I felt this way The location is excellent but it is possible to find much better options at the same cost or even cheaper  |Positive:  Just location
Negative:  Shower enclosure in bathroom did not prevent the bathroom from flooding each time I took a shower  |Positive:  Asked about a room upgrade with balcony The staff offered a great upgrade for 15 Euros more It had a view of the Eiffel Tower Gorgeous 
Negative:  Limited interaction with hotel staff more to do with the position and height of the reception desk relative to the exit  |Positive:  Great location for Pantheon and shopping 
Negative:  Breakfast costs 16 euros but is quite limited no fruits and vegetables are not fresh but most people go for breakfast at nearby cafes anyway  |Positive:  Very good location safe and quiet in Latin Quarter can walk or take metro easily to most attractions and RER directly to the airport And late afternoon I can always have a recess at the bueatiful Luxembourg park around the corner Plenty of nice and affordable local and Asian restaurants I like especially Au P re Louis and Sushiyaki I stayed for six nights and came back for dinner every day This area is only a couple of minutes walk off the major tourist zone but already much less noisy and you got better food and service My room is on top floor and the view is awesome one day I saw sunset on Effel tower and it was amazing 
Negative:  Room is cleaned a bit late in the day after lunch  |Positive:  Bed comfortable staff very friendly location super Early breakfast in the room is very convenient when you are in a hurry like I was 
Negative:  All great for me thanks  |Positive:  The staff could not have been more obliging I arrived direct from Australia was seriously unwell They are definitely worth more than 5 5 for sevice 
Negative:  No shower door so the bathroom got very wet after showers |Positive:  Beautiful room quiet location comfortable bed friendly staff particularly the receptionists who helped store the luggage and giving directions when requested
Negative:  We had requested a quiet room The room we had 404 was connected to an adjoining room through locked double doors It meant we could sometimes hear the conversations of its occupants Luckily they were not too noisy people It should not have been allocated to us If they are going to use two rooms for separate parties then they should brick up and soundproof the connecting space  |Positive:  Well decorated and comfortable room with big balcony window We like the location of the hotel very much and have been back a number of times when in Paris 
Negative:  Room is small but is normal in Paris Facility is a little bit old but kept clean and everything works  |Positive:  Great location staff was friendly and helpful 
Negative:  We were told we got upgraded on arrival to the Eiffel tower view room wow great In we go into the smallest elevator ever 2people max to the top floor The room was tiny but yes the balcony did have a view of the Eiffel tower for what that was worth What they failed to tell us also was that one of the shower panels was completely missing I mean if we turned on the shower the water had nowhere else to go but all over the bathroom floor Crazy We informed reception and were given a different room which turned out to be twice the size of our upgraded room and we could still see the Eiffel tower from the balcony So much for upgrades |Positive:  Nice hotel in a great location Next to Luxembourg Gardens and the Pantheon and 5 mins walk to center of Saint Michel The hotel also has lovely little balconies overlooking the rooftops so i recommend you get a room on the top floors 
Negative:  Lacking on the fine details some TLC will help but it doesn t bother or hinder the experience at all one just notice those things  |Positive:  Great Location Comfortable small rooms Descent though slightly over priced breakfast 
Negative:  The wifi was quite slow at times It seems to be unusable depending on the time of day when hotel guests were around  |Positive:  My room was a good size for Paris The decor was lovely and very french which was nice
Negative:  Size of the double bedroom makes it not too roomy for 2 people The 2 beds were basically set as one king size bed which is not good if you don t want to sleep next to the other person  |Positive:  Beautiful view of the city including side view of the Eiffel Tower Easy access to everything including public transportation and restaurants Nice soft and clean sheets along with soft pillows Clean comfortable bathroom well equipped with toiletries 
Negative:  Some Staff could be more friendly and a proper lounge with a bar to relax in would have been nice Bathroom was very jaded and shower over bath had a slippery surface  |Positive:  Good location and comfortable room Room serviced everyday Buses nearly opposite hotel go to the Gare du Nord for the Eurostar Excellent choice of restaurants a short walk away 
Negative:  In the closet was dust I had to clean hangers at first and then put my things |Positive:  Good location not so far from Notre Dame Cathedral 1 metro station frendly staff beautiful view from room nice area around price quality ratio 
Negative:  A lovely well placed hotel I was however only able to afford it when on offer  |Positive:  Every thing was wonderful The only aspect I would add to the bathroom is a magnifying mirror a great help for shaving and makeup The beds are comfortable and the rooms well appointed though a little snug but one has to remember this is a lovely period building in central Paris The breakfast was excellent and the staff very helpful making eggs fresh to order There was fruit in the lobby together with little cakes and umbrellas The reception staff were most helpful providing maps information restaurant recommendations and reservations 
Negative:  I think the price for Breakfast at 16 euros per day is too expensive but you wont find anything cheaper nearby  |Positive:  Hotel is in a great location with Metro nearby The Luxembourg Gardens are nearby which are lovely to stroll through and are perfect for relaxing in during hot weather The hotel was modern and had a touch of Paris to its interior with staff always haply to help The room was nice and spacious enough for 2 people

Negative:  Staff rude I had pre paid before we had arrived When we got to the hotel because we didn t have the credit card used we had to pay cash on arrival there was no need for this as the room was already payed for so we had to pay twice Hotel is quite old fashioned not up to 4star standards rooms are very small also bathroom Wouldn t return again  |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  Room claustrophically small Very dark decor Even with all the room lights on it was very difficult to see what you were reading or look at a map Lighting better in bathroom which was were we planned the day out If you put your suitcase at bottom of bed there was no floor walking space Handles on chest of drawers came off everytime you opened one Safe wouldn t program right so didn t use it Skimpy small hard towels in bathroom Hotel further out than it appeared on maps to main tourist attractions On line photos made hotel look modern luxurious and large It s a very small lobby and maximum 2 suitcases and 2 people in elevator Hated stepping off elevator into darkened hallway This was due to economy lighting and dark wood and dark colours on walls A few steps brought the hallway lights on and in general place was quaint couldn t imagine coping with kids in such small twin room We d requested separate twin beds but basically got a divided bed with one headboard We made do but was not ideal for two separate adults to use Was ok for purpose used but not one I would recommend to others  |Positive:  Staff very friendly and will g to assist in either English or French Nice clean bathroom Large tub OK water pressure

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Me and my husband stayed for three nights and felt so happy with this hotel The location is only 10 minutes walking from Luxembourg RER Station and also surrounded by fancy stores mini market and some interesting places e g Palais du Luxembourg and Odeon Theatre The room itself was a bit small but very clean and comfortable The best thing about the room was the view We asked to have a best view room when we checked in and the staff gave us a room on the 6th floor with stunning view of Eiffel Tower don t worry be happy they have an elevator Another good thing about this hotel was its short distance to a good Indonesian restaurant named Indonesia Really worth a try please google the location for details 
Negative:  The ceiling in the room was leaking water in two spots in the toilet and beside the air conditioning The cleaning service threw away a hair conditioning of ours and the hotel did not have one to replace it Also there were many bags of garbage from the cleaning service blocking the lift s door and in the middle of the corridor Not very pleasant at all In the Eve s overnight the card did not open the reception door and we got stuck outside the hotel for 10 minutes at a negative temperature until someone opened the door  |Positive:  Very good location

Negative:  I have stayed here occasionally over 5 years The breakfast which used to be quite special has now become appalling The cups and saucers have gone to be replaced by the standard holiday inn mugs The magnificent buffet has gone and replaced with meagre pre laid fruit dishes and not a lot of choice of any thing else There used to be an omelette area that s gone too For warm food you have to choose off Theo Randall s Italian breakfast menu at mouth watering prices If the food we had was a reflection don t even bother The fried rosti tasted like a brick Service too was underwhelming forgotten orders wrong orders etc and the experience all in all very poor If this is IHG s flagship hotel in London then unfortunately the 5 star experience they want you to have in the rest of the hotel is not matched by the breakfast I guess it has been done to make more money with fewer costs Go across to the Serpentine caf for a better breakfast Also there are also currently no toilets on the ground floor except those at the back of the restaurant above which involve a flight of stairs for both gents and ladies So beware if you are not so mobile We will pack our bags and move on to other accommodation next time in London in the future  |Positive:  Excellent location near Hyde Park and Oxford Street Friendly staff 
Negative:  Breakfast buffet has poor selection of foods and I had to pay 27 for the toast and butter I had Breakfast wasn t included in the booking |Positive:  Location Comfort Employees room Almost every thing except breakfast
Negative:  Not enough coffee in our room only 3 packets so one of us couldn t have a second cup The coffee supplied at Breakfast the following morning was COLD and had no taste of coffee whatsoever  |Positive:  This was our second visit and ALL was good

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The staff and the room were very good and we had a bowl of complimentary fruit We did not eat there other than a complimentary birthday cake which was brought to our room Jade on reception was very helpful

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Everything as should be Exellent location Very friendly staff smiley faces all over the hotel They offer you the help without asking Very clean room luxurious room very comfortable bed Taxis available all round clock Hyde Park Corner Underground Station is next door Main attraction in London is in walking distance Hyde Park Green Park Harrods Oxford Street Buckingham Palace Marble Arch London eye 
Negative:  The bathroom requires minor maintenance repairs attention to the sink plug hole to keep water in and the hand shower in the bath needs attention due to a heavy leak when in use  |Positive:  I did not have time to use the hotel facilities for a one night stay however the bar service and staff in the lobby area was excellent 
Negative:  My over all experience was just a disappointment the room quality was less than satisfactory because the view was horrid and it was poorly lit the food was below average it took an hour and twenty minutes to bring up a pair of scissors the hotel was grossly over priced for nothing other than the name it carries extremely disappointed with my stay  |Positive:  The concierge service was excellent Comfortable bed and pillows Very clean over all The bellman was lovely
Negative:  I was promised another room with a better view but when I checked later there was nothing in the system about it BUT when Karem the night manager heard about it he immediately contacted me and came him self to my room to make it right |Positive:  room size attention from staff especially Karem the night manager
Negative:  1 Bed quality is poor King size bed is simply 2 singles joined Pillow choice and mattress is poor 2 No free wifi 3 Room size not great for price |Positive:  1 Excellent location walking distance to most places and tube bus stops nearby 2 Staff were helpful

Negative:  They didn t clean the room one day Had to call 4 times for someone to bring shampoo Ordered Croissants to my room at 7 00 am and they were dry  |Positive:  Friendly staff nice breakfast menu beautiful hotel
Negative:  This hotel needs to match the breakfast to the quality of the hotel  |Positive:  The breakfast is very poor quality and the service terrible The food was like transport cafe food Dreadful quality And at 100 00 for 4 Shocking 
Negative:  Our iron in the room didn t work Not a big deal but I would have like to run it over my dress before dinner  |Positive:  The rooms are lovely we were upgraded to a suite which was wonderful as our stay was for my husbands 40th birthday This made it extra special
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Amy on reception was brilliant and went out of her way to make our stay perfect We even got a complimentary cake delivered to our room as we were celebrating our 10th anniversary Thanks to all the staff 
Negative:  I asked for early check in but the room was not ready and we had to wait a while  |Positive:  The staff treated us like old friends and were helpful without being overbearing I took my car which was parked overnight without any problems 
Negative:  The room was below expectations Although we had a superior king room which should normally have a view it overlooked the back street When we asked the staff to give us a new room the response was that the hotel was too full Having booked a month earlier i dont believe they didnt give us a view room either bc of our late arrival or bc we booked through booking com For this price there are many other hotels which can provide better accomadations within the vicinity It was a definete disappointment on our part My advice is either pay a bit more and prefer 4 seasons or pay a bit less and stay at the hilton They re all 100meters away from each other Having stayed in all of those this was the worst vfm  |Positive:  The location was good
Negative:  Nothing perfect stay  |Positive:  Not only was the hotel of a luxurious standard what else would you expect of a five star on Park Lane but it was the attitude of the staff who really made our trip extra special Upon arrival I mentioned that it was our 10th wedding anniversary and asked if there was a chance of a complimentary upgrade Luckily they weren t full so we got a lovely upgrade to an exec room which was super spacious and a free late check out Not only that when we returned from our meal out the reception manager had organised for a beautiful chocolate gateaux and bottle of red wine to be in our room on the house Such a classy move considering we were already more than happy with the upgrade and really made our trip even more special Considering we re not your average five star hotel clientele I was so impressed by the intercontinental s approach to treating us like VIP S you made our anniversary so memorable and we ll definitely return again 
Negative:  My biggest issue with the hotel were the other guests Rarely have I spent so much time around so many affected rude and ignorant individuals Yes the hotel costs a few quid yes you need a bit of money to stay there but quite why people feel that makes them better then the staff working there is beyond me The rudeness and arrogance of my fellow guests was almost enough to ruin my stay  |Positive:  Undoubtedly a luxurious hotel excellent facilities and a great gin menu The hotel is perfectly located to explore many of the capital s best known landmarks and shopping streets on foot 
Negative:  Breakfast a little frantic restocking of bowls for fresh fruit and even butter at the breads table |Positive:  Great location helpful polite and well trained staff although the breakfadt room melee and staff involved were a little less well organised
Negative:  Nothing none |Positive:  I m very pleased that we choose to stay at Intercontinental London park lane this time me and my sister loved every thing about it we were feeling most welcome everyday every moment I already rated the property 10 but what I really wanted to mention here is the concierge Micheal Petar and the others were so helpful too but those guys manage to find us bookings in no time in the most wanted places restaurants opera etc We felt so spoiled this time thanks to them I totally recommend this hotel the location is amazing to the breakfast buffet is almost similar to our Hotels in the Gulf very tasty with lots of choices not only an English breakfast like any other hotel We are totally booking in it again 
Negative:  The rooms soundproofing is not very good because sometimes I hear sounds coming from the rooms while I am walking to my room  |Positive:  Everything is perfect The reception rooms cleanliness and the staff i really recommend this hotel 
Negative:  Very small amount of milk in room we had to ask for coffee pods too  |Positive:  Excellent breakfast and good service Very comfortable room and bed Personal touch of card and cake for anniversary Proximity to St James Park and Buckingham Palace for a walk the morning after our celebration dinner 
Negative:  The room was too small and messy there was no cabinets to put our staff in except one tiny one and the rest were without keys to be able to open it The toilet was too small and there was a blockage in the bacenet and the water was not going down We ordered club sandwich the presentation of the sandwich was very bad as if I ordered it from a grocery and not from a famous hotel like intercontinental The taste was disgusting I swear I wanted to vomit after I ate the first bite Our stay in that hotel was like a night mare and instead of the staff helping us after all what we faced after a long journey they charged us for 591 instead of 561 for that night  |Positive:  This was the worse experience for me ever i didn t like anything in the hotel and I checked out from the second day and shifted to another hotel

Negative:  Our room was very warm even with A C and didnt have the best view The Mini Bar in the fridge was VERY expensive 3 50 for a KitKat and 5 for a 500ml bottle of water though I guess that the majority of Patrons wouldnt have to worry about the cost of water The Buffet style Breakfast was also a bit of a farce no information given as to whether we helped ourselves gave an order etc and there were lots of children running around Also some of the staff need to be more aware of their non verbal communication  |Positive:  Location and the Chap who s name I sadly forget on Reception was very friendly and made us feel relaxed 
Negative:  10 for two small bottles of water was a bit steep given everything else is excellent value Could hear the guest next door easily at night  |Positive:  Location service and hotel atmosphere amazing Gym looked excellent but not used Five star Checked us in early 11am was fantastic and accommodated us when we were late for breakfast excellent service both times

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Everything was great on my recent stay in that hotel and all was up to perfect in terms of the staff and the exotic services and facility provided by the hotel also location is fabulous One thing I would like to mention about my experience with that hotel i made my booking through hotel booking web site and it was non refundable one month and a half before my Arrival so when I have checked the price of the room I have booked later in the site I found cheaper than the price I booked my room for so I made I contact the hotel booking customer service and explain the matter and they have respond immediately to my request and sent a notification to the reservation department in intercontinental park lane hotel and thay agreed right away to modify it and they sent me a new booking confirmation with the new price offered in the website I appreciate that so much and proof to me that is hotel booking is the best choise to book my hotel in my future trip 
Negative:  Room and in particular the bathroom is a tight squeeze for 2 people and from this perspective I don t think the hotel offers good value for money We also experienced extremely poor service at the Arches Bar which given that we were out celebrating a special occasion affected our evening and would be enough to say we wont be returning  |Positive:  Great location good valet service clean hotel and pleasant breakfast 
Negative:  Breakfast service and food quality not the best for this kind of hotel Personal note poor phone reception 5 for small bottle of evian  |Positive:  Nice room nice common areas good door staff friendly check in

Negative:  There are a lot of migrants around the hotel sleeping in tents Because of the location you can t avoid to walk across these tents which is very scary together with your family One night we made a group of 4 adults at the nearest metro station to get to the hotel safely It is very crazy and it will be worse and worse  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Location is the downside there are a lot of refugees outside HOWEVER it is not as severe as any of the reviews I have seen previously Yes there are quite a lot and I can see how some may be slightly intimidated There are only quite a lot on the walk to the metro but we were never hassled nor stared at or made to feel uncomfortable Police presence further up away from the hotel where the refugees are  |Positive:  Room is good comfy beds good size bathroom and toilet isn t massive but plenty of room for what is necessary Fridge and microwave so we could store our lunch for the day Area has a franprix and 5 minute walk to the metro so you can buy cheaper food to snack on and get to the centre relatively quickly

Negative:  Saw a mouse small rat in or room on the last morning Terrible views from the room Unless you are a keen motorway and flyover spotter  |Positive:  Comfy beds Good room layout

Negative:  Staffs  |Positive:  Staffs are not good They don t know how to deal with costumer and even not respect They are very rude and talk with bad manner They have to learn some more how to deal with costomers If they still behave like this no one come back in Novetel Hotel never and ever They gang up with taxi and charge us lot of money for only 10 minutes way 
Negative:  staff not friendly enough tea bag sugar coffee etc only one provided in the room we are two no milk at all no regular tea bag only herbal tea there is no universal wall socket to charge phone or laptop all mainland european standard hotels must be universal they forced me to buy a converter for a one night use there are plenty of things to improve standard  |Positive:  location
Negative:  Location is in a very economically depressed area There were over 30 homeless people sleeping near the sidewalk on the walk from the metro The rooms have paper thin walls I not only heard my neighbors conversations but also had a nightclub blaring music until 0200 in the morning It was so bad I could hear the words to the songs with my windows closed  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Location of this hotel is very bad its not safe to travel in night time with kids in this area but metro is really close in 5 minute walk We use metro for all our visits  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  outside the hotel in neighbourhood there was too much mess poor housekeeping There were dozens of immigrants camps arround the hotel which is the main cause of mess in the surrounding area  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The location of this hotel is horrible When we took the bus to the station it kept going to a bad neighborhood This hotel is located near a bridge where it is full of refugees and homeless people around When we got off the train people kept staring at us and smelled like someone peed the whole time when we walked to the hotel from the station We felt very insecure Staffs were okay but I feel that they can be more helpful to those who are traveling Few of them were just lazy with their answers Also They don t really smile  |Positive:  The rooms are spacious and nicely designed We also had our little living room which was very convenient And it was clean 
Negative:  The walk from the Metro to the hotel is fairly intimidating due to all the tents and refugees homeless people but everyone left us alone However would not recommend for single females especially at night  |Positive:  Clean big rooms and very good breakfast
Negative:  The area around the hotel was covered with refugees and homeless While we felt sorry for their situation we didn t feel safe The hotel explained that they wouldn t be harmful to us but taxi drivers police and others around warned us to not walk around with the kids especially with luggage etc We did see a lot of cop activity and fights one evening upon returning to the hotel So this limited our ability to make the most use of the metro there We opted to taxi in most of the time  |Positive:  Rooms were very nice we had a ac issue with one room but the hotel was very responsive to take care of the issue Great breakfast Other than that the facility was excellent 
Negative:  Location has lots and lots of homeless people mostly from outside Europe Furthermore there is so much garbage lying around It is the worst neighbourhood I have seen in Paris One does not walk outside feeling safe Staff was friendly but some did not dress like a hotel employee but like tourists Breakfast was not well organized Dirty floor location of food not logical Mediocre food PAPER PLATES  |Positive:  Clean room with decent air conditioning 
Negative:  There are a lot of homeless people living under overhead bridges across from the hospital We mainly used uber to travel to places  |Positive:  Excellent value for money Very cosy and comfortable Staff were very helpful Very happy with the service provided

Negative:  Where do i start 1 Horrible location Even though it was walking distance from nearest metro Porte de la chappelle it was a nightmare walking towards hotel as it was flooded with immigrants who have taken over the pavements trash everywhere my family was really scared at times 2 Its not a cheap hotel during hot hot summer i expected proper working air cons We reached hotel about 6pm we went to bed early about 7 30 to be ready for next morning but could not sleep until midnight as it ir con was pathetic We spoke to reception but they knew it and just said they can t do anything 3 Entrance Thought it would be a decent entrance as i have seen in many hotels of same branch but it was just very average and dull and ofcourse with barely working air con  |Positive:  Breakfast was nice really nice croissants cheese yogurts etc
Negative:  Where should I start This hotel is rated a 4 star although it was a clean facility with good amenities the location was a nightmare for anyone especially families The metro station is nearby but you have to walk through a very very dirty and shady area It looks like a war zone The area was full of homeless refugees that are living under a bridge across the hotel It is not safe to walk from the metro to the hotel You have to take taxi to ensure your safety I do not recommend this hotel until this area is cleaned up and refugees are no longer misplaced I asked for a refund and management refused This hotel location put a damper our tourist experience in Paris |Positive:  The hotel was clean and staff was helpful 
Negative:  the hotel should have highlight more clearly the location of the hotel it is near the overhead bridge where the refugees camp is lotsa of refugees camping under the bridge however sercurity was okay as every nights when we returned late to the hotel we saw police petrol at the area basically the refugees do not disturb the area smell bad though  |Positive:  the family room given to us was big the kids got a lotsa room to play around we had a double bed and a single sofa bed with a pull out in the room loves the separate shower area in the bath room the bath tub is extremely clean and the water pressure was good the room was very clean the front desk service gentlemen were really nice On our first night there as there s no nearby food outlets the service guy proactively recommended some food delivery services and provided us some leaflets and recommendation We had nice hot yummy pizzas and Japanese food delivered right to our room the location is about 8min walk to the Metro easy asses to where we need to go 
Negative:  Too noisy in the street by night Nightclub or pub too close so could hear music until 3 am Room too hot Area and pavements around the hotel full of homeless people very dirty streets just opposite the hotel Would not recommend this hotel if you travel alone by public transport as you won t feel safe to walk from tube station to the hotel unpleasant 10 min walk  |Positive:  Breakfast ok
Negative:  Bathrooms are flooding when showering design fault Still they are clean and large Breakfast lacks vegetables  |Positive:  Great rooms large clean well equipped Awesome staff several games at reception for kids and not only 
Negative:  Terrible parking They let more cars in than there are places available which causes chaos and high risk of having car scratched Location of the hotel is also terrible hundreds of homeless people sleeping just outside so going for a walk is not a good idea I do not recommend this hotel to anyone especially for families  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The location of the hotel isn t the best |Positive:  The hotel the staff and everything else is great but the location isn t so good its a really rough area
Negative:  There were no travel cots available so baby slept on single bed mattress on the floor Nearby shops metro station were convenient though tent camp nearby was off putting to start with If you re paying on card with a foreign currency ask for a full receipt at checkout We re still waiting for one 3 weeks later and not sure if we ve been overcharged for something or if the exchange rate was not great  |Positive:  The room was amazing value for money Plenty of room to spread out for a young family Self contained kitchenette was handy for a long stay 
Negative:  Hotel is located in very rough area of the Paris due to that We had to order unhealthy take aways Unable to explore and experience local area Travel via Uber expensive compare to the trains hotel does not have a restaurant so only choice you have is to order take away or take uber to some nice area to dine toilet is as small as the size of the plane toilet  |Positive: No Positive
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The rooms were big and beautiful nothing to complain about the only problem we had was we had booked adjoining rooms and when we went to the hotel they said they don t have adjoining rooms it was the fault of bookings com to mention that it was adjoining rooms and not the hotels fault so with the kids we had to use 2 rooms which was inconvenient really to be in completely separate rooms and the location is not that great and a little scary to travel after dark the staff not that friendly or helpful either 
Negative:  the breakfast is very basic and the area around the hotel is scary and dirty I was travelling with wife and 2 kids I was looking around us every second to make sure no one was following us The reception area is the same area as the breakfast which is something I have never seen before |Positive:  the rooms are clean and cosy the staff are polite and helpful
Negative:  location was terrible it is across the road from a city of tents of homeless people the room was like a sauna when asked if the air con was broken we were told the only use air con in summer the staff were the opposite of a rae of sunshine Especially one lady that was incapable of smiling I felt very unsafe here and chose to take taxis into Paris and to train stations instead of walking with my family even the taxi drivers would say oh that part of Paris is not very good  |Positive:  The room was nice
Negative:  Location was poor in a rough area with a sote for homeless people opposite Breakfast selection was poor Same selection every day Staff were not very receptive Room wasn t service properly at times and when missing items were requested they would not deliver them to the room you would have to go down and get them  |Positive:  Rooms were clean and spacious 
Negative:  Firstly it s located in a bad place Just adjacent to the hotel are makeshift tents most probably of migrant population It feels dangerous to go alone in the streets Facilities were ok As it was located in bad part of city you want to rely on hotels restaurant But this hotel doesn t have an operational restaurant They claim to provide free wifi but for my entire stay there was no wifi Rooms weren t cleaned properly Someone s inner were lying inside my room Toilet is located outside the bathroom and is one of the size to be found in aeroplane  |Positive:  It was just an ordinary hotel Didn t turn out to be bad but wasn t able to live to the standards of Novotel The only good thing was that they were able to arrange taxi for you 
Negative:  Location was terrible the area was unclean and smelled terrible And in front of the hotel there was a site area for homeless people This made the area very unsafe to walk through especially at night Breakfast was basic to say the least not many options hardly any vege options Hotel staff were not very accommodating to any requests and when something was missing in the room due to poor room service i e No tea bags or no milk or no cups no soap the hotel expected you to come to reception to collect the missing items rather than bring them to the room  |Positive:  Rooms were nice and spacious 
Negative:  the room was so hot I could not sleep overnight also the wifi was so weak I use my data the location was quite unsafe  |Positive:  the hotel was clean and comfort 
Negative:  Room appears clean but smelly Bad odour in corridors as well Breakfast was just as bad as not much to choose from Parking was expensive and difficult to get in and out The area where the hotel was situated seems dodgy Could not wait to get out of that place  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Location is really rough and nothing really around We took uber everywhere to avoid walking around the area as it was really off putting had a lot of beggars Really nice hotel don t know why they would put it in that location |Positive:  The shower was really nice so was the room 
Negative:  The second bed was a bit decieving from the listing We thought we were getting a 2 bedroom suite when in fact the bedrooms are just separated by a curtain  |Positive:  Seemed like a newly renovated or just new hotel Great facilities in the rooms 
Negative:  causing a lot of inconvenience to us and my friend Again requested next day but invain had to come back spoiling our trip due to hotel zero cooperation no refund terrible  |Positive:  Initially counter lady was nice to us but when we asked for 2nd floor room spl request already accepted by hotel due to health conditions she put us on 7th floor not comfortable to us despite repeated requests nothing done we had to stay at friends house for from paris 
Negative:  The location makes you feel unsecure There were a lot of homeless or refugees making homes in tents along the only route from the subway station to the hotel The hotel is also near to the central waste collection center which you must pass by onroute to the subway  |Positive:  Good clean towels without visible stains
Negative:  The location and neighborhood is less to be desired Graffiti everywhere dirty strong smell of urine reffugee camp under flyover Please look after your belongings when approached by beggers When traveling at night use VTCs type very reasonable price |Positive:  Room was very cosy and good standard 
Negative:  Two of my friends had money stolen from our safe and staff showed no interest in helping us one lady on reception actually laughed and seemed to think we were making it up Surrounding area didn t feel entirely comfortable or safe as there is a big group of homeless people Area not well lit and we struggled to figure out how to walk there from the tube station although in daylight this wasn t a problem but there is a very busy road to cross with no traffic lights in parts |Positive:  Really clean comfy and spacious room 
Negative:  Area in which hotel is located is not the best one  |Positive:  Clean facilities are good Espresso coffee machine in room Good Size room Value for money Metro is 8 min walk
Negative:  nothing |Positive:  everything this is best place to stay very nice people there and they speak more than 5 language it was just perfect very clean nice quipements nespresso caf machine in your room and 3 capsules every morning
Negative:  The carpet had holes all throughout it where people had dropped cigerrettes on the floor It wasnt very pleasant to walk over Also asked restaurant staff if they could blend a banana and milk for my son and we was told nope No explanation why  |Positive:  I liked the big spacious rooms the fridge and microwave in room was very handy 
Negative:  Location though not the best is alright and not at all as bad as some visitors find it  |Positive:  Great staff spacious and meticulously clean room breakfast started as early as 6 am very close to metro station except constant plumbing noises heard in my room 
Negative:  We have 3 persons when I booking on this website they described this suite have two bedrooms but in fact only use transparent curtain to separate bed and lounge where put small sofa bed it is totally wrong info from booking com so we have to take one more suite when we checking in the outside of the hotel is terrible dirty and not safe feeling but near to airport and exhibition it is good for me  |Positive:  The room is comfortable and staff are nice 
Negative:  Restock tea and coffee facilities have proper cups for tea and coffee not paper cups have a separate desk for reception separate to shop and bar as there was always people at the desk buying things and not enough staff to attend to customers staff not very friendly no greetings unless you greet them first ironing facility only on one level should be available in every room Our pre arranged transport waited for us outside and we waited inside despite front desk knowing that there was transport waiting for for customers and us telling them we were waiting for transport to pick us up we had to go outside and asked the driver who had been waiting for us for a while when we noticed he was there Very poor service  |Positive:  It was quiet but that was it
Negative:  The area where hotel is situated looked a bit out of city it is near near motorways and recycling facility But then everything else about the hotel covered up for this tiny little shortfall  |Positive:  Closeness to metro station and chick appeal of restaurant
Negative:  The location was terrible it was too far away from the sights area is run down Hotel wasn t easy to find even with sat nav and parking proved difficult to get in and out Breakfast in the hotel was poor quality runny snotty eggs were the only cooked item The same food was brought out that had been out the day before The same Stale quiche had been put out all three mornings I was there  |Positive:  The bed was very comfortable as they always are in Novotel 
Negative:  The price is more relative to the location than the hotel Although the location is ok in relation to getting places in the city relatively quickly we didn t feel the most comfortable walking between the metro station and the hotel as the surrounding area were very run down and did not feel particularly safe at times A small problem was also the fact that we chose a non smoking room on arrival but were given a smoking room This didn t turn out to be that much of a problem though as it did not smell or effect our effect the hotel really but it may not be the best for others  |Positive:  The staff were really attentive and helpful with all queries Hotel quality was really good for the price and there was a good selection of food at breakfast Can t fault the hotel Also had a nice view of the Sacre Coeur from the room Although it is right by busy traffic from main roads the room was silent thanks to two sets of Windows 
Negative:  As a woman travelling on my own I thought the walk the metro wasn t pleasant I was also disappointed that the English language TV service in the room did not work as advertised  |Positive:  The room was spacious comfortable and clean The bathroom was well appointed with no frills The staff were helpful 
Negative:  The staff were super rude and not helpful at all Half of the things in the room didn t work airconditioner fridge microwave When we asked the staff to get them fixed they were pretty nonchalant about it and didn t really sound that interested in it Eventually ofcourse nothing got fixed Also please note that you ll be staying at the very edge of Paris in an area full of Drug Addicts and some other unpleasant creatures Better get a room in the centre if you can afford it  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  If you need to take the elevators you just need to wait for the cleaners they keep it busy doesn t matter if you are in rush |Positive:  Clean and comfortable beds
Negative:  very bad location in a really insecure and unsafe neighborhood NEVER even try to book there there were people using DRUGS just outside the hotel we tried to cancel our booking when we saw the hotel but they d dn t let us The staff was not helpful and grumpy On top of this the TV was broken and there were peanuts behind it they probably d dn t clean t properly also there was a constant smell n the elevators Later on we moved to a different place we were told that the hotel was located in the sketch est neighborhood of Paris right next to the dumping ground A BIG NO if you want to stay SAFE  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Slightly small reception Basic breakfast parking not free although you pay a special rate of 18 euro all day  |Positive:  superb lovely modern room very comfortable beds Secure and Safe Hotel
Negative:  Air con didn t work properly They threw away my water bottle which was on the desk  |Positive:  Lovely spacious room Separate toilet and bathroom 3 sinks Divider in the middle of the room Great location for St Dennis stadium and Gare Du Nord Modern Blackout blinds 2 sets of windows so room was very quiet 
Negative:  Parking is super expensive Hotel staff really dishonest We had several times random expenses always ask for the detail of your bill  |Positive:  Room was very spacious clean and stylish 
Negative:  I booked for 3 guest but only supplied a bottle of water and tea for 1 person When explaining this to the staff the manager was extremely rude and disrespectful immediately She would benefit from doing a customer service course as the treatment my friends and I received was one of the worst I have ever experienced I would never stay here again and I would not advise anyone else to stay here  |Positive:  Nothing 
Negative:  A lot of reviews talk about feeling threatened or intimidated by the area certainly if 10 year old girls and old women begging scares you avoid St Denis is not the nicest of places but convenient for what I needed Avoid the scrambled egg truly awful but good selection otherwise for breakfast I and others took food away for later and no comment was made by staff Take coffee with you not a lot by the kettle  |Positive:  The hotel was close to a venue we were attending also close to a metro Clean comfortable hotel good size rooms and bathroom No tap end on the bath and room enough for two 
Negative:  The toilet extractor did not work and the toilet had a bad smell There is no aircon Lucky for us it was cool weather but I can imagine in hot months it can get very uncomfortable The area is not safe We walked to the metro station and nearly got attacked by a very aggressive black man that approached us in a very suspicious and aggressive manner and swore at us We just kept walking faster and went into the metro station It was very scary as we had our 10 month old baby with us We are so grateful the man did not hurt us  |Positive:  The room was a good size Very comfortable Staff very friendly and helpful 
Negative:  Paying extra for parking The room was so warm we had to keep a window open so was noisy at night as it s located so close to a lot of roads Lots of people begging and living rough outside |Positive:  Friendly staff
Negative:  The surrounding area was at first sight alarming with rubbish strewn all around There also appeared to be a number of refugees and vagrants begging in the area which again at first was a little daunting  |Positive:  The staff were excellent nothing was too much trouble and they had a good knowledge of the area The fact that it was such a direct route for Stade de France we were there for the rugby match France v England 
Negative:  I could not fault anything  |Positive:  Stayed in Paris last year and hotel was poor real disappointment and not what it looked like in photo s We were delighted with this hotel and it really made our stay more enjoyable I would and have recommended it to others since our departure on Sunday The staff were very helpful and friendly 
Negative:  the manager of hotel wants to pay all the money there but in greece there is not the opportinity to take more than 480 euros per week and she didnt accept the card which we have already sent in order to pay the rooms  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The location was not the best close to a metro line but a bit of a strange area |Positive:  The bed and room was lovely very spacious and the hotel itself was very clean and well decorated
Negative:  The nearby garbage collection facility was not somewhere I want to see in Paris Although I did not experience any bad situation the neigborhood does not look secure  |Positive:  Highly responsive staff New wide clean and comfortable rooms Coffee tea water is complimentary in the room The big table in the room and microvawe is a plus
Negative:  Is the worst possible location The hotel is in a run down area right next to a homeless shelter Not great at all when your girlfriend is frightened to walk from the hotel to the tube station  |Positive:  Hotel looked clean but can safely say this is not a 4 star hotel
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  I booked online for my parents and called the hotel with a couple of requests The receptionist was very helpful and professional The booking and payment went very smoothly My parents said that they loved the hotel and that the room was very nice They also loved the breakfast and booked it for the entire stay 
Negative:  The location is fine if you re driving or getting a cab or Uber but as a pedestrian it s a nightmare if you don t know that area There is a metro station nearby but it is really hard to reach it you need to do a huge detour to be able to cross the high traffic streets around the hotel Or maybe there s a secret passage that I missed who knows In any case after walking 10 minutes I felt stupid and just called a cab instead of taking the metro  |Positive:  Soundproofing was adequate considering that the hotel is located right next to the boulevard p riph rique the highway that goes around Paris 
Negative:  Poor housekeeping service Housekeeping staff were not able to understand English Difficult to explain your needs  |Positive:  spacious room Microwave and electric Kettles were provided 
Negative:  The bad part is the location a taxi driver was in shock when he brought us back from the centre of paris he said the area was very dangerous and it felt like that too  |Positive:  The hotel is good big room nice bed the staff is very friendly So the good part is the hotel 
Negative:  This is no fault of the hotel or staff but immediately outside the hotel were people sleeping rough in vast numbers and therefore felt very uncomfortable and unsafe It was at times like walking through a war zone  |Positive:  The room was perfect Staff were fantastic very helpful and couldn t do enough for us we forgot to lock our safe one day and nothing was touched Would recommend this hotel to everybody
Negative:  Just the neighborhood is not so nice the way walikg to the metro we pass on places with garbage everywhere  |Positive:  Spacious rooms with nice view knowing I was in the 10 th floor with a great bathub near to the metro nice breakfast as well
Negative:  Location of hotel is not the best hence the reason there s a security guard |Positive:  Rooms were really clean and I am a very fussy person with cleanness but give it 10 10
Negative:  However the way to that about 10 minutes walks isn t the most pleasure one with some poor families living under the bridge in front of the hotel My family and I didn t had any problem but you you have concerns with security I don t recomend  |Positive:  The proximity to the subway was very good
Negative:  the location I would suggest the hotel to put a tip on their website on how to reach the hotel from the metro station when we first arrived we obviously have no idea which route we should take to reach the hotel and thus ended up walking pass a very dodgy rough and unsafe area more so when you walked at night |Positive:  nice hotel comfortable room friendly staff and nice amenities we were surprised there was even a nespresso machine in the room 
Negative:  The location is very poor There are homeless people living on the streets between the subway station and the hotel No taxis at the subway station you have to walk through a rough neighborhood There are prostitutes in same area Saw some fighting going on so we changed the street we walked on The view out the back from our suite was a vacated crumbling set of buildings with graffiti etc No Eifel tower views from my window  |Positive:  The suite was excellent as it had the things I like including espresso machine fridge microwave dining table large bathtub separate shower separate toilet closet extra single bed couch good double bed fairly close to Metro which is the subway system 
Negative:  Location felt unsafe walking back from the metro at night under the underpass Would not recommend this Fine if you re travelling in a car as this hotel is right on the edge of intersecting motorways Not good if you re using it as a base to explore Paris attractions Stay somewhere else  |Positive:  Staff delightful with one notable exception 
Negative:  Nothing to say all was good |Positive:  Location to main station was excellent and metro station was near by Staff where very friendly overall a very good place to stay
Negative:  As you may have read from other reviews this hotel is not in the heart of town although it s close and you do walk through a less privileged part of Paris It is not far to get into town once you reach Porte de la Chapelle metro station but it is a decent 10 minute walk to the metro in a less than picturesque part of town this may be unacceptable to some people but we managed Let s just say I wouldn t feel comfortable walking back from the station after dark unless I am in a group of 5 guys There are no restaurants takeaway food outlets nearby which was annoying so if you want to venture around Porte de la Chapelle metro station we found a great cheap and nasty pizza place near there Gym needs to have some weights and a bench Aircon was not cold enough for us and we would have liked some bowls and utensils and proper cups vs plastic cups I suggest you look on google earth google maps before booking if you are a bit precious with where you stay  |Positive:  Great amenities and very clean room Good base for us to visit all the tourist sites Nothing exceptional about this place but great value for the price if you compare to other accommodation in Paris

Negative:  The room was TINY for the price The room was only big enough room for a single bed and someone to stand next to the bed The window wasn t much bigger than a computer monitor and was in the top corner of the room similar to what I d imagine a prison to have I was on the very top floor it felt a bit like an attic room Great staff but just wouldn t stay again as I wasn t comfortable in the room  |Positive:  The breakfast was fantastic and the staff were brilliant They were really friendly and always keen to help Very close to Queensway tube and on the doorstep to Hyde Park 
Negative:  Room was so small and bathroom was even smaller Showering resulted in everything in sight being drenched no workable shower screen and pathetic shower headlike  |Positive:  Hotel was relying on its location undeniably good but the room and bathroom sizes will eventually be it s undoing People expect more these days and are prepared to pay more
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The staff and Management were top class and very helpful nothing was too much trouble for them The breakfast was excellent with a good choice of food The rooms were smallish but the service compensated for that Thumbs up for this hotel Good location just off Bayswater Road close to Queensway and Bayswater tube stations 
Negative:  The reception are not polite and some of them don t know what to do when they meet up with any kind of problems Definitely I ll never ever stay there again even still water is not available in this hotel When you ask reception that can I have a bottle of water You will got right away this answer We have got glass in the room and you can drink tab water believe me never try tab water Tasty like stream water honestly it was terrible staying Even if you want to leave one day early they will never refund your money back You have to pay exactly how many days you think at beginning  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  could not get the TV to work not overly concerned Room small but I guess that was to be expected and sufficient these are only minor items |Positive:  room clean and smart 
Negative:  The bathroom was tiny you could sit on the loo clean your teeth and enjoy a shower all at the same time not enough room to swing a cat I had to use the public toilets on returning to the hotel to collect my luggage and unfortunately it was down a flight of stairs and wasn t clean it smelled of stale urine not good  |Positive:  I asked for a quiet room and I only heard one siren but the outlook over the dumpsters wasn t spectacular It was a surprise to receive half a bottle of wine don t like Merlot so my friend enjoyed it but the thought was nice 
Negative:  The room was tiny which was a surprise since it is not a cheap hotel We were told we were given an upgrade I cannot imagine what we were supposed to have Also the shower screen was ridiculously skinny which defeated its purpose The bathroom mirror has a function whereby a part of it does not steam up The demisted part was too high up the mirror for me to see myself thus defeating the object once again There was very little thought put into these issues On the whole I feel we would have got more for our money at premier inn  |Positive:  Breakfast was excellent
Negative:  liked everything  |Positive:  I had to wait at reception for check in for 20 minutes and I was annoyed the kind Italian gentlemen at the reception added FREE breakfast for me and kept trying to crack jokes until I had a smile and accepted the apology The free breakfast was very good and I would definitely of paid for it Variety of things to have I checked out but my meeting was at 4pm they let me wait at the lovely waiting room downstairs until I was ready to leave The staff definitely cared about their customer being happy Thank You I d definitely come again
Negative:  I paid for Club rate and the size of the room was tiny couldn t properly fit 2 suitcases in it Additionally there was only a really narrow small window A friend who paid for the same rate got a basement room with a terrible smell The room bathroom was not well cleaned and necessities such as shampoos soaps etc were not re filled added during our stay I am pretty sure that sheets were not changed either during our 4 day stay The carpet was poorly laid on top of an older one in a very obvious way Staff was not consistent with clients for example the same request book a room for an extra night had 2 different responses from 2 different staff members we cannot please book through the website and yes sure  |Positive:  The only positive is the location of this hotel 
Negative:  The room doors don t have any padding to slow them down so during the evening everyone coming and going sounded like they were slamming their doors  |Positive:  Great old building that s kept in good shape Immediate access to Hyde Park and a nearby London Underground station were both very nice The staff were busy but alert nice and efficient 
Negative:  Hot sandwich from room service was cold Tiny room but this is typical for London especially a single room  |Positive:  Very welcoming staff Requested a room with a bath I received it Gorgeous character and reception lounge area with fresh flowers Excellent price 
Negative:  Service from reception entered my room without announcing and knocked on my door at 11 15 at night and cost of breakfast  |Positive:  Location near two tube lines and Hyde park Public areas were beautiful vintage 
Negative:  The room was very small and it was an upgrade I am a tiny person and I felt a little clausterphobic in the room The bathroom was incredibly small I would not recommend this hotel to someone who is on the larger side  |Positive:  The staff was really friendly and they upgraded us to a coach room 
Negative:  sizes of room and toilets  |Positive:  the rooms were not in good shape The 1st room was so small we could just about get 2 suitcases into the room and then there was no floor space for an ironing board We requested a change The next room was better though in a semi basement but the toilet was so small and the wash basin smaller about 14inchX 14inches the tap looked enormous since the basin could not have been any smaller the pictures of the rooms should be made accurate 
Negative:  The room had no windows which I know the hotel had no choice on but still did feel a bit suffocating Small issue though not a deal breaker And if they could only find a way to fit a mini bar in the room  |Positive:  Awesome location very close to Queensway Tube and Bayswater tube shops restaurants convenience stores Hyde Park Bus Stop Excellent reception and staff Although my room was small which is normal by central London standards it was extremely well appointed Had everything one would need Breakfast was excellent too good spread freshly prepared 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  All the staff were polite and welcoming and arranged taxis do my destination as required You never felt second best Excellent hotel and staff
Negative:  The room was the smallest room i had ever seen It was a struggle to manage to clamber around the bed and not at all like the advertised photos The was a chair in the room pushed under the table but as the end of the bed was behind the chair it was not possible to pull the chair out to sit on It was then a hinderance makibg it more difficult to get around the other side of the bed  |Positive:  The staff were very helpful and polite 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Our room was small as was the bathroomBut it was clean and comfortable The location of the hotel is excellent walking distance to Restaurants and shopping Kensington Gardens is right on the doorstep perfect for an early morning run It s an easy walk to many attractions including the Portobello markets The hotel is charming with comfortable lounge areas 
Negative:  The rooms were tiny This was a deal breaker I do not recall seeing sizes when I booked but I acknowledge they may have been listed at that time I know they are listed now because I looked it up If we could have pivoted and stayed somewhere else we would have but it was not practical From what I can see all the hotels in this area had similarly but slightly larger rooms The single induced claustrophobia We usually all meet in a room to discuss plans etc That was impossible in this hotel  |Positive:  The hotel was very clean Breakfast and tea were great Service was great at the meals as well Common areas were beautiful Each room had its own temperature control including AC Location was great 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Location was very close to the Queensway tube easy to find friendly check in and check out Bathroom was very clean and recently refurbished I will look at staying here again as it is ideal for my business trips 
Negative:  They tried to move us to another hotel citing maintenance issues We refused and a room suddenly became available The rooms were not as grand as the reception area  |Positive:  Near to Hyde Park which is what we wanted
Negative:  Being double booked and asked to leave being rebooked into someone else s room and receiving no compensation for time lost and stress and inconvenience  |Positive:  Location
Negative:  the shower sprayed water everywhere  |Positive:  good breakfast selection and quality complimentary water and teas were great A wonderful last minute stay in a hotel that felt part of the history of London yet was beautifully up to date in facilities
Negative:  Rooms a little small but to be expected for the location and price otherwise fantastic  |Positive:  Staff were friendly and great location especially for the price 
Negative:  Noisy both out on the street and in the hotel Double bed was two single beds together  |Positive:  Lovely old building pleasant staff Very handy for Hyde Park Concerts Lancaster Gate Tube Station about 5 mins walk 
Negative:  Deluxe twin booked A big deal made on checking in that we were getting upgraded to superior A bit insulting when we saw the tiny room with the twin beds with no gap between them If that was superior I d hate to see deluxe What on earth is standard like  |Positive:  Good location
Negative:  Nothing to fault |Positive:  Staff were amazing and attentive from the moment I arrived at reception desk The guy at reception was checking 3 separate groups in at once so nobody had to wait Got me a room with a bath as I asked for Gave me late check out the next day I have stayed in lots of hotels all over the world for alot more money and the service here was one of the best I have ever experienced 
Negative:  Our room it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in it was not suitable for two people or fit for purpose I booked a Superior Double Room it was not a double and definitely not superior I had to lay on the bed if my husband wanted use the bathroom I have stayed in many hotels including in Paris and this is the smallest by far When we arrived at the hotel approx 9 30pm there were people in front of us at the desk who where been called taxis in order for them to be moved to a sister hotel due to maintenance issues which can only be construed as an overbooking issue Also we had to wait for our room to be fixed cleaned as it was not ready when we arrived so late in the day although we did receive a free drink in the bar for our inconvenience For the price we paid it was not value for money  |Positive:  The building history edwardian design in the public areas 
Negative:  The room was very small and quite shabby and tired looking The actual building itself is beautiful but the decor is very tired looking and scruffy in places Our tiny room looked over the back of the hotel and was of rubbish skips that had overflowed onto the path so not very pleasant to look at In view of all this we felt it was very overpriced  |Positive:  Good breakfast A beautiful old building full of character Comfy bed Quiet 
Negative:  The room was on the 7th floor tucked away at the end of a corridor by the staircase therefore quite noisy until late at night The room was the tiniest room that I have ever stayed in and I travel a lot to London and abroad The regular size double bed filled the entire room with hardly any space around it to manoeuvre I literally had to shimmy down the side of the bed to get into it and also in order to reach the bathroom The room was advertised as a superior double but in my experience it was only standard and due to the small capacity and lack of space would be better utilised for single occupancy The photographs within the booking details are misleading  |Positive:  The location was perfect for an event we were attending in Hyde Park The room was clean Helpful staff who responded to my concern about the comfort of the room politely 
Negative:  When I landed in London I received a call from Grande Royale Hyde Park booked via your website They informed me that they had maintenance issues and that they transferred me to another hotel with the same rating After visiting another hotel Paddington Hotel which was more distant from the Hyde park and looked like it should have 2 3 star rating I went back to the Grand Royal and demanded the room Magically the room was available About 30 smaller in size than the one I booked Towels with hair on Sorry its far from 4 star Disaster  |Positive:  Location 
Negative:  The only problem i felt was the double room was more like a single room so when i asked 2 be moved they were helpful 2 accomodete us with another room  |Positive:  It was central for 2 get where you wanted 2 be it was nice clean staff were helpful polite 
Negative:  By room could have been a little cleaner There were stains on the walls and on the lampshades  |Positive:  It s in a beautiful location I love the old English feel the lobby has And the staff is very nice 
Negative:  The room wasn t ready when we arrived fair play we were given complimentary drinks while we waited it s just a bit irritating paying all that money I wouldn t then expect to wait plus my friend is heavily pregnant so that made it more annoying and difficult for her after a long journey  |Positive:  Good location easy enough to get to by tube from Kings Cross and lovely that the history has been preserved Great choice at breakfast I ve stayed twice with different friends and they both agreed it was lovely 
Negative:  Hotel was overbooked due to multiple people booking same day on booking com Hotel went above and beyond to accommodate us so all ended well  |Positive:  Great restaurant wonderful atmosphere and excellent location 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Our stay at The Grand Royale marked the start of our honeymoon we arrived to a bottle of wine chocolates a selection of fruit and a handwritten card in our room The staff were attentive and pleasant and we were allowed a late check out at no extra cost Breakfast was superb with a huge choice of cooked or continental options We loved the building with its extensive wood panelling and beautiful friezes on walls and ceilings the history of the building made for interesting reading too We were delighted with our choice of hotel and will return when we next visit London we highly recommend The Grand Royale 
Negative:  Hotel is a little tired in some public areas that need re painting  |Positive:  Very comfortable bed in a double room on the 6th floor so it was nice and quiet Good location within a few hundred yards of Bayswater Road and only four minute walk from Bayswater Tube station 
Negative:  Some of the back stairs to the rooms could do with a bit of sprusing up Bar area also needs some touching up  |Positive:  Staff very friendly and helpful hotel rooms and lobby spotlessly clean Rooms are small but perfectly formed with all mod cons 
Negative:  Double room was a little cramped and would have preferred a bit more room but we had all the facilities we needed for a short 2 night stay  |Positive:  A really good location close to Hyde Park and Central London Staff were polite attentive extremely friendly and helpful We will definitely stay here again when visiting London Good value 
Negative:  Our room was incredibly small The hotel rooms look lovely in the photographs but in reality seem a little tired and run down We paid a very reasonable rate for the room through Booking Com which was reserved several months in advance but we noticed that the general prices closer to the date were hugely inflated at prices that could not be justified for what you actually get Also the communal toilets in basement Not great when group of rowdy young men burst in when wife alone  |Positive:  The location of the hotel as we were visiting Hyde Park The history ambience of the original Edwardian house hotel although not all confirmed Would love to be a fly on wall back in the day Some very beautiful ornate decor on the ground and upper ground floor We wondered about the history as part of write up states you can very much feel the presence of Lillie Langtry especially in the Theatre Bar where she allegedly put on shows A very interesting property 
Negative:  We had booked one night in a twin room but were told on arrival that they only had doubles Staff offered a discounted second night as compensation but we were unable to take them up on this so still ended up paying the not insignificant full cost of the room for an uncomfortable night s sleep sharing a bed |Positive:  Friendly staff
Negative:  Tiny room and bathroom so small that the door couldn t open properly due to toilet behind it Lots of noise coming from outside and view of bins and rubbish from room window  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Rooms are very small Could barely move around We weren t in it all that much but make sure you pay attention to the size of the room you are booking  |Positive:  Staff was wonderful Location was perfect 
Negative:  Couch pull out bed The mattress was so old it sank to the middle and I had to hang on to the furniture beside the bed to pull myself out Also slept for the week with the bars under the mattress poking me in the back and leg Asked for different mattress but wasn t available Needed to just buy a new mattress and throw that one away The main bed was wonderful but I wasn t the one sleeping there unfortunately  |Positive:  The front desk staff was phenomenal Super courteous wonderfully helpful finding directions arranging transportation giving information The bell hops were so professional too We didn t have to lug another suitcase once we arrived at the hotel Felt very safe and well taken care of except for the horrible pull out bed mattress 
Negative:  Nothing really I was very happy with it  |Positive:  The manager of the restaurant was excellent had eyes everywhere The room was small but it was a single room and for central London I was very happy with it really The bathroom was lovely Easy walk to Paddington Station Comfortable hotel 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The location and price was great Rooms in London are generally small so make sure you pay attention to which size room you pick If you book the smallest square footage room you will probably be disappointed with the size Don t pre pay breakfast during check in for the first morning if you might be jet lagged It ends at 10 AM and you probably will oversleep 
Negative:  We booked as it was stated that they had parking available which they didn t When we got to the property they had no twin rooms despite this being what we booked  |Positive:  The hotel was in a great location
Negative:  My room had an insect problem but that was quickly resolved It s other things such as the drapes hanging off the rod and the dirty wallpaper and carpeting that were concerning The shower sprayed the whole bathroom impossible to contain without a bigger glass panel or shower curtain It is a lovely building but needs some upkeep inside  |Positive:  Service for breakfast was excellent Manuela especially Staff was very responsive and that is becoming rare 
Negative:  I paid for a superior room and the room was the size of a small walk in wardrobe The shower didnt have a curtain soo the floor gets completely soaked Their large towels are big enough to dry a young child It was ridiculous |Positive:  The hotel was very old fashioned which you don t see alot these days it was designed nicely
Negative:  The room was on the small size as well as the en suite Did not see a tip box for the staff as I would have most definitely liked to have given the staff something they were absolutely wonderful which made up for the room being on the small size  |Positive:  the bed was comfy the breakfast had a wide range to suite peoples taste The location could not have been better with bayswater tube station and queensway within easy walking distance Most of all the staff were so kind and friendly nothing was to much trouble for them 
Negative:  Good location with easy access to Queensway underground station Although our room had been recently refurbished and comfortable it was referred to as a Club Room but was very small Friendly and helpful staff but the property could do with a major makeover  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Bedroom and bathroom where on the small side but we didn t really need any more space as it was only a short stay |Positive:  Very comfy bed and fantastic breakfast
Negative:  Twin room is tiny with very little natural light No hotel parking available  |Positive:  Great Location easy to get to using public transport and round the corner from Hyde Park 
Negative:  The size of the bedroom Super small bathroom shower far too small No possibility to open windows for fresh air What happened in case of fire Looks obvious they have been maximising the profit by reduced rooms size  |Positive:  Price location staff
Negative:  Small rooms Noisy air con units Little sleep due to noisy neighbouring buildings Room at the back of hotel overlooking the bins |Positive:  Well presented entrance
Negative:  Do not test the fire alarms without informing arriving new guests that are jet lagged and sleeping This was extremely upsetting  |Positive:  The location was convenient to buses and metro Hyde Park and Kennsington Gardens are right there The staff made up for a major inconvenience 
Negative:  Towels were small room was a bit on the tight side Provided shampoo and body wash smelled good but left odd feeling on hands  |Positive:  Large bathroom quiet air con it was a heat wave when we travelled free WiFi handy phone to take with us with internet access USB and international adapters provided in convenient location Staff were lovely 
Negative:  Tiny room Bathroom very small Shower size the smallest I have every been in Fridge not cold Iron and Ironing Board cheap and barely worked Complimentary water 2 x small bottles not complimentary No notification of such  |Positive:  Good Air conditioning and Comfortable bed 
Negative:  Staff friendly very Clean and a walk back in time to style of the communal areas  |Positive:  It was reasonably good lovely old building Albeit the superior room is there standard room so a confusing play with words So it was a squeeze to walk around the bed We didn t have breakfast there at London hotel prices 
Negative:  I noticed the lack of a face cloth in the bathroom I guess this is not a British convention  |Positive:  The breakfast buffet was excellent staff attentive The staff overall were friendly and helpful 
Negative:  To be honest I was disgusted with the hotel My friend was too big for bed ad he s 6 1 and the bathroom was a joke Tempted to ask for my money back  |Positive:  To be honest I was disgusted with the hotel My friend was too big for bed ad he s 6 1 and the bathroom was a joke Tempted to ask for my money back 
Negative:  The shower cubicle was very slippery and no hand rail  |Positive:  We were upgraded to another hotel as grand Royale was having plumbing problems We were given transport and breakfast for each day of our stay 
Negative:  Toilet was too close to wall almost had to sit sideways Shower cubicle was too small I m not large but it was all too close for comfort  |Positive:  The hotel was in great location next to Hyde Park Excellent reception lounge and bar area full of character and even a claim to have been bought for Lily Langtree to perform for her King Immaculately clean Room very comfortable and modern albeit rather small Breakfast was included and was very good served in a beautiful dining room 
Negative:  There wasn t anything I did not like |Positive:  Extremely friendly staff very comfortable facilities many amenities in a very desirable area of London Excellent breakfast
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Convenient location near two tube station Very close to the city and all main attractions The hotel is situated in a historical building that is well kept I stayed in delux single room for 6 nights The room is small but it has everything you need Wifi is available in the room and is free of charge good value for money 
Negative:  The exceptionally small bedrooms A double room can nearly fit two people and two suitcases 2 people cannot walk around the room at the same time  |Positive:  Old world decoration very friendly and helpful staff Good breakfast Good location for central line and Hyde park 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Loved the afternoon tea Every afternoon a staff would come bring chocolate to the room the Underground was right across the street staff was nice and helpful with suggestions and I slept on a cot because there were 3 of us in a room and the cot was actually very comfy 
Negative:  Bedrooms a little small |Positive:  I travelled with my wife On arrival we were not given the room that we had booked First night was not very comfortable but the management were very apologetic and very helpful thereafter 
Negative:  Tony rooms  |Positive:  Location is very good near 2 tube stops however rooms are super small Tiny in fact and I was a single traveller in a normal room and have no idea how 2 people could fit 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  On this occasion I had a decent sized quiet room on the top floor The public rooms are very atmospheric with dark panelling stained glass and comfortable chairs 
Negative:  The toilet flush did not work properly The sink could not be reached as it was so small Cold tap could not be opened without excessive force |Positive:  Price per square meter foot has been in top three of places I have stayed Room was 1 8m by 2 9m plus bathroom of the 1 2x1 8 Total surface 8M 
Negative:  Very but I mean very small rooms Tiny bathrooms In my room the window was stuck and not open even a little |Positive:  Great breakfast good staff especially Razavan at reception Magnificant Edwaridian common rooms and loby 
Negative:  Noisy neighbours and banging doors but the staff handled the problem beautifully once I d rung through to reception and also the Manager spotted the notes when I was checking out and asked if the problem had been dealt with  |Positive:  The building is beautiful with so many wonderful period features the staff friendly and efficient and once the tubes had closed for the night it was wonderfully quiet on the lower ground floor Super convenient for Queensway tube station too I d definitely go back 
Negative:  Room was slightly small but given the location and ambience of the hotel was prepared to accept that as a small negative  |Positive:  Breakfast buffet was great with the option to request a specific dish
Negative:  The rooms are small but it is central London  |Positive:  Stayed for a single night to see a show 1st rate staff 1st rate service very helpful very welcoming Easy access to Hyde park which we strolled through to shop on Kennisington High St on day 1 and then left the bags at the hotel after checkout the following day to visit Oxford St Queensway tube station is just on the next street

Negative:  Poor room facilities Says on their website you have an iron in the room but you have to request it Rooms are TINY For a 4 star to not have any room service is poor Has a fridge which was empty No guest service book had to guess how to even call reception I travel a lot for work and would not go to this hotel again  |Positive:  Comfortable bed 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The location very close to Hyde Park for pleasant walking and to Queensway Tube Station for the Underground s Central Line to Oxford Street and shopping and local restaurants shopping etc and Notting Hill Gate ditto
Negative:  Double booked at Hotel and Hotel has yet to refund me me the cancelled booking Have disputed double charges with my credit card company and the issue has yet to be resolved in my favor  |Positive:  Location was ideal for our purposes 
Negative:  The first room allocated was a lower ground room which was dark and very small We relocated to room 508 which was the same size as the first ie very small We hardly had room to move around in what was advertised as a super delux room Both rooms were smaller than you get in a modern budget hotel at twice the cost Room 508 did not have a ventilation system in the toilet this was corrected after I mentioned it Also the complete sink tap system had come away from the wall I guess it did work  |Positive:  Beds comfy
Negative:  Wifi is too bad I was at room 602 club room most of the time I could not go through This is quite important for me traveling for business otherwise I have to use my local carrier which cost me a lot as it is international  |Positive:  The location is perfect friendly staff and good value for money 
Negative:  There was nothing to dislike  |Positive:  What an absolutely lovely time we had at the Grand Royale From the upgraded room to the fabulous breakfast and very attentive staff Nothing was too much trouble I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone Faded Victorian maybe but absolutely beautiful Thanks to all who made us so welcome 
Negative:  It is obviously not the hotel s fault but there are major building works adjoining and opposite which could be going on for some time Some of the rooms are small and a bit claustrophobic  |Positive:  Excellent location Hyde Park just across the road restaurants of Queensway round the corner The lounges and bars are very atmospheric in a Jacobean sort of way panelled and dark but very relaxing The staff are pleasant and generally helpful The price is reasonable given the location 
Negative:  For a superior 4 star room it was small with a microscopic en suite Acceptable but disappointing For the price breakfast should have been included Better value breakfast was found close by Try the Italian gardens in Hyde Park  |Positive:  Location was good and room was clean and comfortable Staff polite and welcoming 
Negative:  The rooms were very small just a bed and enough room to walk around it Good thing we didn t need to spend a lot of time inside our hotel rooms other than to sleep  |Positive:  The location was wonderful Near public transportation as well as within walking distance to several important tourist sites The public spaces inside the building registration lobby etc were absolutely fabulous just as beautiful as the pictures on their website That s why I picked this hotel In my price range ALL the hotel rooms in London were extremely small but the Grand Royale London Hyde Park had the gorgeous common areas that set it apart from the rest The rooms were clean the staff very nice and the breakfast was delicious 
Negative:  The only down side was the room size It was certainly adequate for one person travelling light and staying for one night For two people staying two nights there was very little storage and hanging space for clothes It was clean and it was comfortable  |Positive:  The hotel was conveniently close to Hyde Park where we liked to walk It was close to two tube stations bus route and taxi services A convenience store was close by The hotel is a lovely old London town house style and the reception hall and public areas I would describe as Baronial The staff were attentive and polite and the lady on duty at reception was particularly thoughtful and kindly Our room was very clean and tidy though rather small for two people that said we were quite comfortable 
Negative:  My sister will soon be having hip surgery and getting up the steps to enter the hotel was difficult for her as there was no handicapped access  |Positive:  Staff was very friendly and helpful and responded quickly to requests and questions The English breakfast was well stocked and a good value for the cost The history behind the hotel was interesting The lobby library and theater bar were beautifully decorated and took us back in time 
Negative:  i need to cancel my last day booking due to schedule change but was rejected by booking com and hotel disappointed with the poor flexibility  |Positive:  good location and average price breakfast is nice 
Negative:  Rooms very small Bathroom tiny but very clean and modern Hotel is very old and needs new carpets Wonderful wood decor but needs refinished It could be a beauty I probably would not go back  |Positive:  Park across street Bus and Tube very close The hotel has a nice welcoming fruit basket with chocolates and wine Coffee and tea supplied 
Negative:  The size of the room could be greater but our criticism on this point is minor You could arrange for a common pot for tips The staff was excellent but we were told that one only pays tips to a given person for services rendered e g porter I wanted my tip to be placed for the benefit of all the staff  |Positive:  The room was tastefully decorated and well appointed The facilities such as lighting and bathroom were excellent However it was slightly too small
Negative:  The room was so tiny we could hardly believe it even after an upgrade to a bigger room It was smaller than our bedroom at home The view from our room overlooked a backstreet loading bay for a nearby restaurant takeaway which instantly took the edge off having a room upgrade I couldn t help thinking what view we would have had from the smaller room The pictures online of the reception lounge area are bang on it looks lovely however the rooms are nowhere near what is shown The advertised rooms must cost an absolute fortune I ve spent over 100 less per night in London for bigger rooms better views and the same facilities The overall experience nowhere near justifies the cost  |Positive:  As it was my girlfriend s 30th birthday the reception staff very kindly gave us a free room upgrade to a shoebox sized room I can only assume our original room was the size of a matchbox A plus point was the free to use smart phone in the room although we didn t use it for fear of the cost involved if it was lost broken stolen while we were out and about 
Negative:  All good |Positive:  We stayed at the only magnificent suite in the hotel We loved the overdone heritage feel and big space both in the suite and bathroom We were 3 adults and one toddler in this suite Breakfast was great as well and the location right next to Hyde park and Kensington gardens is perfect for kids Mommies can go shopping on the Westbourne grove 
Negative:  1 Close from the tube station but a little bit hard to find out the location surrounding by houses 2 Window cannot be opened so hot  |Positive:  1 Welcome service for honeymoon was so touched 2 Luxurious atmosphere at reception area 3 Close from the tube station 
Negative:  Rooms on floor 8 a little small but adequate  |Positive:  A lovely Victorian hotel with original features and very friendly staff Very clean did the business for a short stay in London Excellent nights sleep 
Negative:  We had two rooms and we would have preferred they be on the same floor However this was a last minute reservation and it was not possible This was completely understandable  |Positive:  The entire staff was exceptional location ideal and rooms comfortable The staff went above and beyond to provide us with every comfort and kindness during our stay In particular Razvon at the front desk was top notch in every way imaginable The accommodations were excellent but Razvon s warm hospitality took the experience to the next level I highly recommend this beautiful historic and gracious hotel 
Negative:  The room was a little cramped and there was no iron ironing board Apart from that amazing  |Positive:  The staff were extremely pleasant and welcoming The hotel decor was amazing best we have ever stopped in The room was lovely very clean and tidy 
Negative:  I feel the breakfast should be included in the room rate its an expensive hotel to start with  |Positive:  The ambiance of the hotel was fantastic the breakfast was superb
Negative:  We had a Superior Queen room and to say it was a tight fit for two people would be an understatement The room was so small you could not actually turn around on one side of the bed I have a bruise on my arm from whacking it a few times on the handle of the closet as it was so narrow going into the bathroom and out the door  |Positive:  The location and price were great the staff was really friendly and helpful and the hotel is spotless 
Negative:  The hotel was a total disgrace in all aspects my bag in the luggage cart was stolen right under their nose when I was checking in What s more disappointing is the hotel s response regarding the incident I had little to no help from them even after complaining about their poor service The hotel only helped call a cab but then abandoned us at a police station far away around midnight Before leaving the hotel told us that they will provide roundtrip service Even after requesting for pickup from hotel twice no one came to get us After the incident no employees or mangers reached out to us as if nothing occurred We had to insist managers to meet us when they did they were neither condolence with our loss nor try to help us in anyway They were utterly rude and did nothing but wasted our precious vacation time As guests of the hotel the hotel has responsibility to ensure our safety including our belongings Even if hotel can t replace my stuff at least could offer help in any way rather than being immature and heartless  |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  Rooms are tiny i think you should be v clear on that Charging for a bottle of water on our second and third night is not good as it cost us one thousand euro to stay there the least i would expect is fresh water every day  |Positive:  Bed was v comfortable staff v helpful 
Negative:  The rooms were very small advertised as a superior double room but it s more like an average bedroom And for the amount paid you would definitely expect a little more the room was so cramped and I felt as though the bed was too big for the room there wasn t enough space to pull the stool out from the vanity mirror draws as the bed was in the way and there was only one side upon could access the bed from Honestly I was very disappointed with this hotel and probably won t be returning to London for a short stay again and if the other hotels are like this I definitely won t it s awful that hotels can charge that much for a room and it be that small Not sure if I may have looked wrong however the photos on the website showed a 4 poster bed which when I purchased the superior double room I expected to get and if what I got was a superior double room I would like to see how big a suite is Another point would be the view I wasn t expecting a lot from the view because obviously it s not up high it s you average house size however The view was very poor however it s understandable that they can t change this but again for the money you pay you would expect a little better One rude female member of staff at reception See first paragraph you don t get what you pay for at this hotel not sure if this is the case throughout London however it is here I am almost 100 sure that I booked the hotel room and I received free breakfast for both myself and my partner however we did not receive one and the female member of staff I previously mentioned was quite rude about it and told me that we had to pay 15 each if we wanted it also of your thinking of site seeing I wouldn t recommend this hotel as it s quite far from the main attractions like the London eye or Houses of Parliament and the Thames but there is a tube station round the corner which was helpful  |Positive:  The bathroom was very nice and well kept The male staff were very helpful at front desk at night and so were the general staff that helped carry your luggage they were very kind and helpful however there was a down side to the staff as they were let down by one female member of staff who I thought was quite rude in her mannerisms and the way she spoke and definitely needs to either try and enjoy her job or find a new one honestly working can be crap and boring but get over it we all have to work However not to discourage the other female receptionist who checked us out as she was very helpful and friendly 
Negative:  The photos are enhanced on the Internet as in reality the hotel is very very dark inside and if I m honest a bit dreary From outside it looks really poor and needs a paint and clean of Windows It needs sensitively being freshened up throughout The decor is not consistent so a bit hit and miss Bedrooms modern but not comfy beds or pillows sadly Perhaps we had the smaller type room and should have upgraded We had very little space in ours that a glass fell from the bedside table and smashed as you could not move freely I wouldnt stay again  |Positive:  Location was very good as we could walk from Paddington station with our overnight bag The staff are very good and friendly and efficient Nothing too much trouble Did not eat there so can t comment on this sorry Tea and coffee and extras in the room were very good Nice big tv and enough towels provided Controllable heat for room was good too

Negative:  Had amended booking but they didn t have the amendment had to wait for reservations to confirm even though I had proof restaurant far too small had sittings for breakfast so had to book time but they still couldn t accommodate us at the time and there was no room to pass tables Walls thin could hear all toilets flushing and showers running from above below and either side  |Positive:  lovely hotel great to look out on to hyde park and walk through to the centre of London staff are polite but don t have authority to rectify things just explain politely that is policy
Negative:  The layout of the bedroom through the door and immediately down five steps to the bed not good if ur unsteady on your feet Also the floor boards in our room and the one above squeaked quite badly  |Positive:  The location was ideal being very close to a tube station Also being close to Hyde park if you like walking The staff were friendly and helpful We had the chocolate and prosecco afternoon tea which was very tasty 
Negative:  They were renovating at Xmas time scaffolding out front and fireplaces not being used and lounges pushed together We had booked many months beforehand and were not advised of this Should have been offered discount and given opportunity of going elsewhere Also toilet hard to use as it was too close to basin and shower I was very disappointed |Positive:  The old England style of the hotel

Negative:  sink in bathroom too small and plug let the water out because it didn t fit properly Bathroom could have been a bit bigger  |Positive:  The old fashioned interior and the helpfulness of the staff
Negative:  No need to change towels daily but no way of saying please don t Having fair trade branded tea coffee sugar in room would be a great plus for me  |Positive:  Warm comfortable room Very polite and helpful staff Near tube bus QUIET 
Negative:  It was quite a small room clean and quiet but with not a lot of space Overnight it was very cold We asked for and received an extra blanket and a heater on the second night but shouldn t have needed to ask for it  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The London weather  |Positive:  The staff were exceptionally attentive and genuinly friendly looking after us in a fantastic way The hotel is very centrally locatef to all the main attractions having 2 tube stations witjin 4 min walking distance There are plenty of shops and tasty restaurants all around the hotel 
Negative:  The room was tiny It was so disappointing considering I booked a superior room As soon as you opened the door there was 6 steps leading up to the room There is approx A foot and a half distance between the edge end of the bed and the steps Lots of renovations going on the front and inside the hotel  |Positive:  Location was good right around the corner to two different tube stations about 2 3 minutes walk with access to the central district and circle lines Across the road from Hyde park Kensington gardens Staff were friendly and helpful Bed was comfortable and good bathroom facilities 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  It was exquisite beautiful Room was a little small and shower room tiny I think you might have problems with it if you re any bigger than a size 18 Overall though fabulous location for birthday celebrations 
Negative:  Room was small but manageable we weren t visiting to spend time in a hotel room so it wasn t much of a drawback  |Positive:  Beautiful hotel with great late 19th century decor Helpful staff Recently renovated comfortable bed roomy bathroom Great location Tube stop just a block away Nearby commercial street with plenty of restaurants
Negative:  The room we were in was small compared to other Hotels we have stayed in Also mentioned to reception as I left fingerprint marks were on the bathroom door and the door jamb maybe needed wiping down as part of the room cleaning process  |Positive:  Bed comfortable only used the room no other facilities Location good bus nearby straight to Oxford Street and elsewhere 
Negative:  The hotel rooms are quite small They were clean but in need of decoration The entrance foyer and dining rooms are tired and somewhat dated and the breakfast while okay is expensive if not included in your rate We didn t like the fact that upon arrival we were told we couldn t have the rooms we booked and they were on 2 different floors We booked these rooms over 2 months in advance We were given a complimentary breakfast in compensation but our stay was spoiled by not having the rooms we requested meaning my daughters had to share a double bed I would not rate this hotel as a 4 star it s a 3 in my opinion  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Felt very deceived by this hotel booked a room at the grand royal to be contacted to be told we would have to move hotel we were being moved away from the original location that we booked the hotel did provide a taxi to take us to the new hotel but the room in this hotel grand Paddington court was a lot smaller and very cramped I would not of paid the price we did for the room if I had seen it before hand I feel this hotel is intentionally deceiving customers by allowing them to book the grand royal knowing that they will be moved on arrival would not recommend at all Bathroom was ridiculously small and the room was not suitable for a family of 3 Would never use this chain of hotels again |Positive:  Hotel was clean and complementary breakfast was given due to the inconvenience of having to move hotel
Negative:  Bed was too small and the property was loud This was the only property I used a debit card in and on return to the US someone in the UK area cloned my card and used it to withdraw cash Not recommended  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  View from room was of a wall wasn t made aware of construction of building and change of room before arrival which was disappointing |Positive:  Bar area is excellent barman looked lonely though hire him a friend staff on desk very helpful
Negative:  Lady rang asked if we wanted room cleaned we said yes but she never cleaned that s ok we asked at reception they said she must have picked me up wrong but yes means yes at the end of the day so we said just leave clean towels for morning but they didn t arrive unhappy about that  |Positive:  Very close to subway friendly staff
Negative:  The room was tiny really small it barely fitted the bed in it really The window was not very secure or soundproof heatproof was old and breezy But my main gripe is that on arriving I was told I have to provide a credit card I didn t have the same card on me as I booked with so embarrassingly had to use my partners however despite the hotel being paid for in full they then charged my partners card without telling us for the full amount When I got home I noticed that I had been charged twice and I phoned them up which took over an hour of being kept waiting on hold to be then told that yes there is a mistake and it will take 6 days for the money to be returned to my account It would have been a nice stay but it was marred by these issues  |Positive:  The bath was lovely great having a decent bath with central tap The room was clean and the hotel was in a good location 
Negative:  Very basic and ungenerous place without feeling Having a drink in the bar and reading newspaper Staff member dimmed lighting at 11 35 pm Really rude Towels grey instead of white Bedding low quality You just feel like a package being pushed through a system on the cheap  |Positive:  Location
Negative:  Shower involved high step up and over which was cumbersome for this older traveler  |Positive:  Extremely friendly knowledgeable and helpful staff from restaurant recommendations to booking cabs a big plus 
Negative:  The room was absolutely tiny the smallest I ve ever stayed in My boyfriend is 6 3 and they put us in a room in under the eaves The night staff and staff who checked us out seemed so disinterested MTV was playing in the lobby which did not suit the decor or 4 star status We were also not informed of the renovation works being done The whole facade is covered in scaffolding and the fireplaces in the foyer are covered over with big sheets of a plastic and one is completely blocked off with sofas The building work outside woke us up at about 8 30am this may have been acceptable if we had been warned prior to our stay or even when we checked in but it was not mentioned at all and this is really good enough Our stay was not that of a four star hotel  |Positive:  We liked the cleanliness of the room and Valeria who checked us in 
Negative:  Scaffolding outside the building due to renovations and fires in reception were not lit  |Positive:  Beautiful hotel clean tidy Breakfast although extra was outstanding Complimentary extras were a lovely touch 
Negative:  we weren t advised of the renovations taking place at the time of booking the facade was covered by scaffolding and sheets which made the reception and rooms dark The rooms are very small and claustrophobic the rooms we were upgraded to on 2nd floor had flimsy paper blinds that failed to open and those that did provided an unpleasant view of the backyard of neighbouring flats and bins However the rooms we moved to in the basement 003 and 004 were much more spacious  |Positive:  All the staff were fantastic courteous polite and extremely helpful They offered us complimentary breakfast and upgraded us to Club rooms then upgraded us again to larger rooms They went out of their way to ensure we had a pleasant stay for mum s 70th birthday The building is beautiful and full of character The location is great A stones throw from Kensington Gardens Palace and Hyde Park 
Negative:  When we arrive the hotel we 3 rooms for 7 nights were asked to move to stay at another hotel because water warmer in our bathrooms don t work Without prior notice and without any other option even the booking has been done about 1 2 months in advance we were very disappointed It was unprofessional and unacceptable even the new hotel was not bad but we were inconvenience with its location far from tube station  |Positive:  None 
Negative:  No tea or coffee replaced on our second day but that was soon rectified by the front of house staff |Positive:  The Hotel staff made our stay very very good My Wife I were celebrating my 65th Birthday The Hotel gave us chocolates and wine to help us celebrate A very nice touch Thank you all
Negative:  We were first shown Room 624 which was so small It should only be listed as a single CERTAINLY not as a double But we asked to be moved and they showed us a couple of rooms and one was much better So I cannot fault the service The bathrooms are fabulous best I have ever seen However the pictures on the web site give a very different impression of what the hotel is actually like Very clever photography gives a very false idea of the size of the main areas The bar and lounge areas are tiny and not big enough to accommodate the amount of people that could potentially be staying there We came back in at around 10 30 pm and there was only one space left for us to sit at in the bar area Others came in later and had to stand Unfortunately for us the hotel is being refurbished at the moment so wasn t looking at its best with scaffolding covering the whole building and many features inside were covered up with settees and flower stands removed Which is a shame as it is a beautiful building All in all a nice stay but not a great one  |Positive:  Room was very acceptable with nice touches
Negative:  Although the breakfast was lovely due to the size we were asked to state a time for which we wanted to take it This was a little difficult but it didn t affect our stay we would use the hotel again  |Positive:  The Staff were extremely polite and helpful the single rooms although small were very well equipped modern and clean 
Negative:  I had the best experience ever Thank you  |Positive:  I was standing near Bond Street Station by the traffic lights contemplating whether to travel back home to Luton or stay a night as I only had to travel back the next day for training The booking was easy and within half hour of me booking I was in my room It was the best process ever for me that day I was very comfortable the staff were great because they interacted with me and noticed that I had stayed there before with that I was given an upgrade as you could imagine in my head bonus my day is getting better It s a great location for leisure of business 
Negative:  Small rooms Confusion at my check in could not arrange me a room due to maintenance problems Offered me to stay at a hotel nearby After 30 mins they manage to sort me a room at their hotel  |Positive:  Excellent Location Clean 
Negative:  The only issue was that the duvet was too light and too small for a double bed So we had to keep the heating quite high to compensate The bathroom was small but had a bath The room was clean when we checked in but the quality of housekeeping in the subsequent days was not the best They never cleaned the spot of toothpaste that fell on the sink counter The check in process was a pain We arrived at 1 30 so 30 minutes early than the check in time so the room was not ready That was ok and we decided to wait in the hall No one ever came to tell us the room was ready and after 45 minutes I had to enquire and the person at the check in desk did not know and had to go and ask someone else When we finally got the key 5 minutes later we had to wait another 5 minutes to get our luggage which they insisted to put away instead of leaving it with us in the hall Overall the experience was ok and the price quality good for London  |Positive:  The hotel is located 2 minutes away from 2 underground stations so it s very convenient It s perfect for a stroll in Hyde Park as well as you just need to cross the road The hotel hall is very beautiful the building is a period building and the hall and staircase seem to belong in an old period movie We had a club room and it was quite small It had a nice alcove where the wardrobe and desk were but the bed area was quite narrow The bed was small but very comfortable 
Negative:  Small room very unkept in the decorating side pealing paint and at the back of the hotel so very noisy |Positive:  The staff are amazing very attentive and very knowledgable
Negative:  The fact that the room we had booked was out of service and we were sent to a smaller Grand Royale hotel  |Positive:  The breakfast that we had to make up for being sent somewhere else
Negative:  Room very old wallpaper coming off wall and covered in marks carpet coming away from wall and where joined together Bed very hard and uncomfortable bathroom very small but has been updated Terrible smell coming into room through air con vent we phoned reception who said they knew about it and were trying to fix it but we never heard anything disappointing This hotel is not for us  |Positive:  Great location to Hyde park and tube stations Beautiful reception areas and staff welcoming Shower was great and large wardrobe space 
Negative:  Wouldn t stay here again after all the trouble we had got to the grande royal hotel about half 10 at night in which they said to us oh did u not get a phone call because aparently half of the rooms didn t have hot water in which they offered us a drink and taxi to a sister hotel On arrival here the hotel was no where near as nice and we felt we had been fobbed off a little bit totallly dissapointed we went to our room which was nice and comfortable the only problem was after the first night we wanted room service in bed for our second morning and to watch tv turns out this hotel couldn t even provide us with the basics as the wifi had gone off all the phones had been cut off and the TVs were shut down with no signal on the screen Totally dissapointed I made sure staff where aware on our last morning I took it upon myself when I got to the sister hotel to trip advisor the grand royal as my partner had booked it as a surprise for part of my Christmas present on reviewing these it seamed the hotel since September had been selling the same scam story about hot water issues and plumbing Avoid  |Positive:  Breakfast was nice
Negative:  Booked in October for a better deal and found that on the night of staying in January it was around 20 cheaper Staff unhelpful when informed basically couldnt care less Rooms were far too small as was the bathroom which had rusty nuts on light fittings and hairs on cups and in bathroom Back of bathroom door was very dirty Very disappointed so went elsewhere for breakfast Definitely won t be staying again in this very tired hotel  |Positive:  Location
Negative:  see above window looking out on the rough side  |Positive:  Room was very clean comfortable although a little on the small side The only negative would be that the outside was off putting with scaffolding Close to all the shops and travel stations Would stay again 
Negative:  There was no fridge within the room we stayed in and the room was quite small Also we found the breakfast room way to small we felt we were sitting on top of each other whilst eating our breakfast temperature was far too hot  |Positive:  The location of the hotel was just right for us 
Negative:  Building work under way but was not informed when we booked For food only breakfast and snacks no lunch or dinner in the restaurant Floor boards in room all loose and very noisey and shower screen to small so all water went on the floor  |Positive:  location and the staff are very good Breakfast ok
Negative:  Initially we stayed in room 235 We couldn t sleep all night due to the extremely loud noise from the pipes It seems that there is a problem with certain rooms this noise However to credit the hotel when I complained the next morning we were moved to another room which was perfect  |Positive:  Excellent central location very professional courteous staff breakfast buffet was great 
Negative:  The room was tiny and not enough storage for 2 suitcases and clothes in wardrobe more like a single room with a bed for a double room Reception was ALWAYS busy so always a que building works affected aesthetic and breakfast room use yet but price still the same snacks limited etc in bar and served in packets not expected for star rating  |Positive:  Its proximity to central line was exceptional
Negative:  The room was not cleaned properly The tables were soiled and food on the floor after the room was cleaned Not very thorough  |Positive:  The bed comfy and staff pleasant and friendly We were upgraded to a bigger room for free 
Negative:  The attitude of the staff during the check in The assumption that I wanted two single beds even though I booked a double room How the attitude of the staff changed when they found out we were a gay couple So called technical problem with the room I wouldn t recommend staying here  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Even though Im a genius and booking com said no deposit would be taken and no prepayment was required the hotel still took out a deposit from my credit card prior to arriving  |Positive:  As this is our honeymoon and we had advised when we booked we were pleasantly surprised to have a gift basket of fruit and a box of chocolates on the bed when we arived

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The location is good Near hyde park and Quinsway and Bayswater metro stations The hotel is good but could have been better You can find a lot of restaurants and coffee shops around within 5 min walk 
Negative:  Room was super small Very very loud you could hear everything outside the hotel and inside Very uncomfortable bed  |Positive:  Decent location but not for us as we thought we would be closer to winter wonderland 
Negative:  When we arrived they told as that they didn t have any room available and they asked as if we wanted to stay in another hotel they had We said no we had booked this room 2 months ago At the end they found a room available in the basement with no window etc we didn t accept and then by miracle they found one available on the 6th floor The rooms are very small |Positive:  The hotel was near the metro Renovated bathroom Very clean Coffee machine in the room Comfortable bed
Negative:  Rooms were too warm at times The bedding only included a duvet and no top sheet Shower was extremely small with very low water pressure  |Positive:  Close to shops and 2 tube stations

Negative:  The bathroom was tiny  |Positive:  The d cor was good staff were friendly and the room was comfortable The stay consisted of myself and a friend just for one night We didn t have breakfast at the hotel so I wouldn t be able to comment on the food quality The hotel was perfectly located to get to Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park A short cab ride or 35 minute walk 
Negative:  The room was so small for 2 people We had to take turns putting our suitcase on the bed to get things out and hanging our coats on the one chair made it so tight getting to and from the bathroom Our room had a horrible smell of damp which was very unappealing unable to get any fresh air in the room so it was very uncomfortable  |Positive:  The property was beautiful we stayed right before Christmas and it was just so cosy warm and beautiful inside Really close to the tube so very convinient 
Negative:  I don t see how any improvements could be made to the quality of the room cleaning services and position of the hotel I would definitely return  |Positive:  The room was tastefully furnished and very quiet I particularly appreciated the deep pile carpets and the individually controlled central heating in my room during the cold Christmas period The windows were well insulated too not something to be taken for granted in England With Kensington Gardens literally 1 minute s walk away it was lovely to unwind after a busy day sightseeing with a walk in the park 
Negative:  Really straggled with the pushchair as there s no disabled access ramp at the entrance and our room was at the ground floor so we had to lift it again  |Positive:  Location is excellent
Negative:  Surly unhelpful staff and no room available Reception staff economical with the truth regarding reason for unavailability Frankly told lies most unhelpful Would never go near the place again |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The hotel was clean our room was small for a club room and it was on the lower ground so no view Had I been Informed about the scaffolding and work being done in the main dining room I would of looked for an alternative property for our stay This was disappointing as it was a special evening I booked for my wife as a surprise  |Positive:  Breakfast was good quality and fresh

Negative:  The room was tiny we had an upgrade to a club room at check in as it was bigger which was very nice of them the superior double room must have been like a cupboard if this was the case Feel like 160 odd was a bit steep for a small room Shame about the scaffolding on the outside but that couldn t be helped  |Positive:  The hotel staff were excellent and the bed was very comfortable like the idea of the portable handy phone Very homely place WOULD DEFO COME BACK if slightly cheaper 
Negative:  The double room is rather tight and there is no space for large luggage or movement in the room Rather disappointed no robes or slipper or shower cap Complimentary bottled water is given on 1st day but not on subsequent days as compared to other hotels that I have stayed  |Positive:  The plus point of this hotel is its location which is between two stations bays water and Queensway There are lots of eateries and we are spoiled for choice 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The beds very comfy but not enough room to move round kept hitting my toes on the bottom of the bed The staff were very helpful especially at breakfast as the big restaurant was closed and there was not enough room for everyone so we had to have our breakfast in the bar and it was not very warm overall we would go back again

Negative:  My boyfriend and I wanted to spend a special Christmas in London and decided to splurge on what was advertised in pictures a lavish London hotel The room we received was nothing like the pictures advertised It was very small and very plain the decor was very outdated and looked like it was from the 70 s or something The breakfast was 15 pounds per person which is ridiculous The staff messed up my room payment which made the check in a nightmare The bar staff did not know how to properly make drinks Overall I was thoroughly disappointed with the hotel Our room looked straight out of a Motel 5 and was so small we could barely move around not exaggerating we could barely move This was not a supposedly a 4 star grand royale hotel I will never go back here and do not recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a lush place to stay in London For the amount we paid we expected a lot more Its not as advertised  |Positive:  The lobby was beautiful 
Negative:  Our room was in the attic I think It was very small indeed However we didn t explore other options and it was cheap so we don t take it personally Room a little tired and should really be sold as a single  |Positive:  Typical old London hotel looking a bit tired from former glory days First floor reception area has a nice homely feel and staff were pleasant and efficient The price was right and we didn t look much further you don t mess around in London over Christmas

Negative:  The place was nothing like the picture on the website We requested a crib for our baby and they gave us a baby playard and a blanket After they put it together we didn t fit The room was underground no view the heat didn t work and the bed uncomfortable I didn t even bother complaining since it was only one night but I regret not spending 20 more Ando going to a better place  |Positive:  The location especially the proximity to the park
Negative:  The room is extremely small and the double bed barely fit Ultra small wardrobe combined with compact space made living from large suitcases quite uncomfortable  |Positive:  Excellent location near Hyde Park Queensway little shops and restaurants rail stations Hotel itself nice and quaint

Negative:  Upon arrival we couldn t see hotel only scaffolding very disappointing nobody told us about renovations Reception staff very helpful but overall hotel is very tired rooms not at all like pictures paint flaking duvet cover didn t fit bed net curtains dirty I would say a rating of 2 3 at most such a shame as staff were so nice  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  I didn t feel safe within the hotel and unfortunately had problems on the night of my boyfriends birthday as a man who wasn t staying at the hotel was very drunk We he to get staff to come redo the bed sheets which was really embarrassing finding pubic hair on our sheets The hotel did do us a upgrade as we was scared the man that was very drunk threatened us The police was called sadly it did ruined our night and the upgraded room wasn t special enough to save our trip personally I wouldn t recommend the hotel I had saved to take my boyfriend to London  |Positive:  The location was very good and was the best part of staying there was able to get my boyfriend to the winterwonderland
Negative:  Nothing negative to say |Positive:  Everything was beyond expectations Have stayed there before and will definitely make it my first choice again Highly recommend
Negative:  We didn t get a room on our first night apparently there was a problem with the boiler so we had to go to a sister hotel called the Metropolitan hotel This was very inconveniant given that we lost a lot of time getting there and returning the next day In addition we didn t even know where they would bring us to even though we had to pay for the whole duration of our stay upon arrival at the Grand Royale The sister hotel did not meet our expectations either When we returned to the Grand Royale the following day we had to wait again in order to get our room All in all we lost a lot of time waiting around which was quite annoying given that we only stayed in London for two nights  |Positive:  We were compensated for the inconvenience caused by the defective boiler on the second day of our stay by getting a room upgrade

Negative:  There are two truths to this property s description Yes it s in London Yes it s on Hyde Park This is where it ends The Grand Royale is no hotel It is a hoStel Whether it s the mouse hole rooms lonely soaring lobby or the other fooled tourists making life miserable for the teenage staff you will regret staying here The room wasn t clean the double bed accommodates two half people and the toilet shower and sink are located together in a phone booth Spend a few quid and upgrade your stay somewhere else  |Positive:  Staff was barely accommodating 
Negative:  They state superior double room But not kidding it s a box size The 1st room had no space on one side of bed a day was 1ft space between foot of bed and wall We requested change they did but then 2nd room smelt of damp So 3rd time lucky  |Positive:  Staff were very helpful and nice

Negative:  Lifts rated as for 6 persons which could only accommodate 2 people with luggage before the overloaded alarm sounded But as the hotel was undergoing a major facelift this may have been a factor  |Positive:  The times gone by grandeur of the reception area and other public rooms This coupled with the ultra modern interiors of the bedroom to which we were upgraded as it was my wife s special birthday All the staff we encountered were pleasant and most helpful from the moment we arrived Secure car parking available within a few hundred yards as was the London Underground

Negative:  Bar area was musty smelling and the Sauvignon Blanc Chilean no choice was suitable for your fish and chips Rammed into the tiny breakfast restaurant admittedly due to current hotel restorations but just not great even after having to book a time to make sure it wasn t to busy  |Positive:  Two minute walk from tube small but perfectly formed bathroom plenty of fresh clean towels and ironing board arrived in a matter of minutes after being requested I could just about set the board up and Iron my shirt without the need to kneel on my bed just

Negative:  Work was being carried out which we weren t aware of the rooms were TINY very little space to get around the bed and the beds were small our feet hung over the edge despite having booked a deluxe room There was no decent public space to relax in either the theatre was freezing and the lobby was unappealing despite the lovely photos The cleanliness of the room was poor very dusty lots of marks on the walls and floor and the sheets had not been changed since the last guests The staff did try their best including moving rooms as the heater was making a noise in the first room but the move itself was very shambolic They did apologise and gave us complementary chocolates and wine but we shall not stay here again when there are lots of other lovely hotels in the same area for the same price  |Positive:  The location was fantastic
Negative:  Bar could have stayed open a little later |Positive:  Staff really friendly and professional breakfast fantastic standard room a little small but clean modern and had everything you need

Negative:  The first room we were giving was a basement room which was tiny and freezing as the window wasn t properly sealed which in December isn t great They did however move us to a slightly larger room which was nice and warm I thought overall it was very expensive for what it was  |Positive:  Best thing about this hotel is definitely the location 2 minutes from the tube and right on Kensington Gardens which was fab The staff were friendly and when we did have a problem fixed it right away 
Negative:  The value for place is absolutely ridiculous The price we paid was totally high compare to the standard received I would give this hotel 3stars minus just for the location The hotel charged mi 150 pounds before my arrival without saying what it is for I have of course paid fully for my stay at the time of check in so in my opinion this is overusing my credit card details |Positive:  I like the location and probably the staff was trying to assist to accommodate mi in the hotel when three floor was out of order
Negative:  Bedroom was the smallest I ve ever stayed in and apparently we were given a free upgrade to a Club Room God knows what the standard room size is like They accidentally booked someone else into our room and blocked our key card but apologized and gave us a free bottle of wine  |Positive:  Reception Area has character but has scaffolding over the front of hotel at moment Staff were friendly and attentive

Negative:  Grand Royale is extremely tired and run down for a hotel charging these rates Decor was extremely shabby and facilities were of a poor standard We had to ask to switch rooms as the TV didn t even work and we were told it couldn t be fixed Walls were marked in corridor and our room and stains on the divan bed This hotel is in need of either a huge refurb or needs to drastically drop its rates  |Positive:  Not much at all really 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The hotel is quaint the room tiny location is good overall satisfactory but pricey especially as no breakfast is included a continental breakfast would do 
Negative:  It was the worst experience I reached there 12 am as scheduled but the reception staff informed us that there is no room available due to boiler problem They have waited till we reached the hotel to inform us that there is no room They never contacted us or phoned to say anything Moreover they have send us with a taxi to a horrible hotel with nasty smell and noisy AC which we couldn t use to heat the room so It ended up with a tiny electric heater beside the bed  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  We booked a superior double expecting something double and superior our room 711 was just a bit bigger than a large cupboard my wife and I had to squeeze against the wall for one another to pass we are not heavy weights we were not informed that the hotel is under refurbishment at the time of booking therefore not expecting the facilities to be severely limited and certainly not expecting the breakfast to be served in the downstairs lounge where tables are closer than Macdonalds restaurant There were many people complaining and the atmosphere for staff was not good and despite this they were cheerful and trying to please guests  |Positive:  Friendly and helpful staff I imagine it is a nice hotel if you could access it all During our stay it was covered in scaffold and the whole first floor was out of bounds which includes the dining breakfast room
Negative:  My reservation was double bed deluxe however room given maximum I could say single superior and when I complain to the receptions they says hotel are full And no compensation was offered  |Positive:  location good
Negative:  Room small and smelt like drains stained bedding yuck Room 001 right by a staff door that banged every few mins from dawn Def not worth then money  |Positive:  Beautiful reception area and dining room Friendly and helpful staff Breakfast extra but nice with enough staff to keep on top of the tea coffee demand 
Negative:  I had a sleepless night at this hotel the room 807 must have the air conditioning system outside it There was a hum of noise from this system all night the equivalent of an idling car which was impossible to sleep through I won t be staying again  |Positive:  Location is the only thing this hotel has going for it 
Negative:  The front of the property was covered in scaffolding we were not made aware of this We were in the basement although nice rooms no view or phone signal  |Positive:  The building has great charm the entrance and history along with the location The bed was very comfortable and the room was well stocked the staff were always happy to say hello and there were plenty of staff to offer assistance

Negative:  The room was small but the character of the hotel made up for it in a large modern hotel you could wake up anywhere in the world and it would look the same not here you are in London  |Positive:  We booked for a 50th birthday weekend and had a great stay very friendly staff kind and generous gifts left in the room thank you Spotless room with a very modern bathroom

Negative:  The room was tiny extremely small and not well laid out at all There was no fridge for us to keep anything in and we only had water on the first night Not worth 411 for 3 nights at all and definitely not 4  |Positive:  We ended up staying at the Paddington hotel as there were issues with the hot water here 
Negative:  I ordered a bottle of Prosecco for my arrival we were delayed a check in by 15 minutes whilst this was organised then when I got to my room there was no bottle I had to call reception and wait 10 more minutes The pictures online make the rooms look MUCH bigger than they are to the point of being unbelievable  |Positive:  A wonderful reception staff very helpful the room was clean and kept well stocked The location was great and the cost was in keeping with the amenities and locale The bathrooms were well stocked with everything you could need and the bed was comfy and getting was powerful

Negative:  The fact we got separated as a family we booked 2 double rooms and a triple room so we could all be together but rooms were split across 3 levels and a mother and 2 kids meant for the family room had to be split up due to maintenance in the family room that nobody notified us about so caused some upset for the kids could of been a bit more efficient as waited at least an hour of our time to sort this out overall |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  I didn t like being asked to move hotels as they had a boiler problem I was also disappointed that the large lounge area with open fire which I had enjoyed on a previous stay was closed off and we couldn t use it  |Positive:  I like the location and the great restaurants nearby 
Negative:  I read the reviews about how small the rooms are but did not believe how TINY it is until I saw it You literally cannot have 2 people walking around at the same time The staff are not fully informed about London and transport which was unhelpful for me as a tourist  |Positive:  The room was clean with modern clean bathroom Friendly staff Great location
Negative:  The bedroom and ensuite were very small but well modernised Renovation work was progressing so the main dining room was out of action making the smaller breakfast room very crowded  |Positive:  Loved the breakfast the quiet yet convenient location and the fascinating history of the place which is said to have been refurbished by Edward VII as Prince of Wales for his actress mistress Lille Langtry The ornate public rooms are lovely as is the pocket sized theatre 
Negative:  My room was cancelled They offered me to move to another hotel i didn t agree so one night we spent in a small room in basemen The next day we moved on the first floor in a standard room  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  as i booked online well in advance the cost of the room was held on my debit card i paid by credit card but am still waiting for the amount stopped on my debit card to be unblocked iwas told it would be credit straight away dont think this should happen as i am not rich and need every penny so i am without funds at this time because of this |Positive:  staff really helpful clean and tidy
Negative:  There were building works on the outside of the building which we were not told about and found this very disappointing however having said that they did not affect our stay at all  |Positive:  Location is excellent Staff are lovely Rooms are small but very cosy and adequate Decor in main lobby is very Victorian

Negative:  bathroom was TINY shower was the size of a small phone booth you could barely turn around The room was so small there wasn t room for a chair for the small desk  |Positive:  Location was great staff was very helpful
Negative:  Unlike every other hotel I have ever had to book for colleagues this one refused to take payment in advance over the phone which put me in an awful position they should say they don t take payment other than face to face on the website Awful customer service I was waiting on the phone for 40 minutes and then instead of even trying to help they said just come in  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The building is under construction the rooms are small old a bit dirty Very than the pictures and various prices in different websites |Positive:  The location was great
Negative:  Lock on bedroom door was broken Exterior bedroom doors were filthy and everywhere looked like it was in need of a good clean redecoration and some tlc At checkin we were told we d been upgraded to a family suite The room was depressing and when we asked reception tif we could see the room we d booked we were advised that there weren t any available The upgrade was clearly a con We d have been much more understanding if we d been told the truth from the outset The family suite was a major disappointment dingy with dirty marked walls and carpet that looked grubby and threadbare around the edges Hotel was run down inside and not at all like the internet photos The bar was unfriendly and uninviting as was the furniture It lacked atmosphere and the carpet was filthy especially around the Windows The beds were comfortable but not sure why we had two single beds when we d requested a double When we mentioned the door lock to reception to be fair they removed my 5 00 beer tab from the bill My wife did not drink her unchilled glass of white wine and the rather surly barman reluctantly didn t charge for it which was appreciated No restaurant or room service We were very disappointed as nothing about this hotel felt or looked 4 Staff were pleasant enough  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The first room I was given was 801 which is right at the top of the building in what feels like the attic and the water heater in was bubbling all night and I could not sleep  |Positive:  The staff were really helpful and when I asked for a change of room the staff did this instantly and I have a much better room in the basement section 
Negative:  It wasn t the hotel I oringinally booked we were moved to this hotel Then I find out there wasn t enough beds so they wanted to move me a third time again but i refused They had a pullout bed which was only big enough for a child wasn t happy especially being there 1 nite stay and had excursions booked in  |Positive:  The staff were ver good and friendly
Negative:  At arrival I was assigned to a room that looked more as a closet or pantry than a guest room It had a step right at the entrace and it was so small that two persons were not able to stand around the room at the same time Then we asked for a room change then we were transferred to a larger room not big with a bed barely capable to fit a couple of a standard size The lobby is depressing it seems to be from the Queen Victoria era  |Positive:  The staff is very courteous and offer great attention 
Negative:  We got upgraded to a Club Room Lord knows what standard is like Room 222 almost behind a cupboard door next to a fire exit it looked like Room very small with the tiniest of windows which was frosted and when opened looked out onto a passageway full of air conditioning vents and old cars Bed has broken springs so every time one of you moves the other rides the wave Bathroom clean and shower ok but really poor value Bar closed at 11 and breakfast was a whopping 15 each we didn t have it  |Positive:  Reception staff helpful 
Negative:  I had a Superior room which was probably a single in a past life very small Not great value for 168 per night Bar service was very slow as the barman kept disappearing  |Positive:  Very little other than the location 
Negative:  The room was a little small but that is to be expected in inner London To compensate we were within 1 minute walk to Hyde Park  |Positive:  Staff were great and when they realized we were celebrating our Golden Anniversary they prepared a surprise for us in our room which was lovely The hotel is Grade 1 listed and has all the original features in the main rooms and the hotel has an interesting history 
Negative:  Rooms small difficult to actually sit down at the desk air con didn t work properly  |Positive:  Staff were really friendly Location was great for morning runs in the park
Negative:  The bed was one of the most uncomfortable I have ever slept in and very small for a double Good job only 5ft 4 The bathroom was very small The shower was adequate but you could not turn in it  |Positive:  The hotel was situated exactly where we wanted so an ideal location We didn t use any facilities and it was just a base However the staff were really friendly and professional The hotel was clean 
Negative:  overall appearance of the hotel requires a little attention love the original character shame its not used to a better advantage Bedding very poor and room very small even in the Club rooms Decor bland and dated  |Positive:  The staff are very attentive extremely keen to ensure your stay is pleasant and enjoyable Their interest appears very genuine and without exception the staff are this hotels greatest asset location adjacent to Hyde park was lovely in the Autumn 
Negative:  The room size was small and the bathroom was extra small but we made it work out OK  |Positive:  Location was excellent near Hyde Park the train underground and bus routes Food was superb Atmosphere was old English just as we d hoped 
Negative:  The bed linen wasn t changed we were there for 2 nights also want that happy that on our little balcony we had a sex toy  |Positive:  We were a 2 minute walking distance from the tube station and Hyde park

Negative:  Decor and condition of rooms dated and tired Very small room but I guess it is London  |Positive:  Hotel bar very nice place to have a pre drink Very friendly and helpful staff
Negative:  Arrived to find beautiful building in scaffolding Queues at reception and some guests being moved to other hotels Never did find out what the problem was but the chaos was not handled well by staff and there were sections taped off with no entry signs Had requested to check in one hour early but room not ready OK so they had a problem Won t hold that against them Asked to see room anyway as it was a very special occasion and I had upgraded to a so called club room Taken first to a tiny twin and was told the beds could be pushed together Asked for a proper double room and was eventually shown one but it was still absolutely tiny Frankly if I hadn t been on a time limit to get to the theatre I would have found somewhere else The bathroom as mentioned modern and clean was little more than a cupboard The room was VERY small and there was no natural light Windows were covered in permanent papery blinds to disguise outside bin store area We were told that it was one of the best rooms in the hotel but I don t see how it could be or how you could get smaller Just labelling the door Club Room is meaningless My basic beef is that I paid extra for what I considered was a very basic room Didn t have breakfast there After checkout manager emailed me to ask for feedback and assuring me he was there to help in any way he could I gave him feedback and two weeks later he hasn t replied Sadly would not stay again Booked it as was such a beautiful old building but what a disappointing experience  |Positive:  Very clean though tiniest bathroom ever Comfy bed SOME staff porters very friendly 
Negative:  Bedroom was very small a foot between bed and wall window It was also very uncomfortable Everything was small shower area towels etc On arrival they tried to get me to move to a sister hotel  |Positive:  They left us alone
Negative:  Rooms were very small and the noise from outside was clearly heard What sounded like fireworks at midnight a police car at 3am  |Positive:  Excellent wi fi The bed was comfortable The lobby is lovely but who sits in a lobby for long 
Negative:  A huge disappointment for me was the hotel is going through extensive restoration I booked this hotel after a great deal of research on the basis of staying in a historic building with British charm and character What I discovered when I arrived was the fact that the hotel s lovely exterior was covered in scaffolding the gorgeous public areas you see on their site were closed including the dining room This was not disclosed when I booked and I wouldn t have reserved if I had known in advance They requested full payment on my credit card when I checked in and I regret agreeing to that as I should have cancelled the booking and looked elsewhere So if you are expecting to experience what you see on their website you will be most disappointed  |Positive:  I liked the location as it is very easy access to Central London I have friends in the area so that made it convenient for us to get together Tube stop is a minute away hotel is close to Paddington Station if you are coming in from Heathrow and there are plenty of shops and services in the area 
Negative:  As an old building it s a bit of a maze walking around the hallways |Positive:  They had a very comfortable bar lounge where I was able to have business meetings They were one tube stop from Paddington Station where the Heathrow Express terminates in London
Negative:  The staff in the kitchen lost it at one stage waiting for a time for coffee and taost |Positive:  The staff and the room was fantastic I would like to stay again soon thanks
Negative:  Avoid G Floor I was in room 023 and got terribly disturbed by the smell of the food I guess it was from either the breakfast room or the kitchen Not good for resting  |Positive:  Good location It is closed to Queensway Station and Hyde Park 15 mins to Bond Street and Oxford Circus Indeed ideal for those who enjoy running either in the morning or afternoon 
Negative:  Small room couldn t open the window shower is small and when you take a shower it floods the entire bathroom no bed side lamp so either you re in extreme light or darkness bed is small there are cracks on the walls and they re falling apart Oh yes and no coat hangers |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  We couldn t buy the breakfast we had been told they are to busy to supply all guest with breakfast it is rediculouse The bed linen was stinked Rooms are very tiny and toilet bathroom are so small you can t dry yourself after the shower no room for it The four stars on the website of this hotel is fake it is hardly three stars by UK standards I will give it two stars  |Positive:  Location Bathroom was very clean
Negative:  Our room did have a window but we were not able to open it no daylight and blin glass Very small room and very small bed considering that 2 people should slep in there  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The room was absolutely tiny Never stayed in a room so small and to think it cost almost 500 Euro is awful First night bed was so hard we woke up with pains moved room to a smaller didn t think it was possible to go smaller room we couldn t walk into the room together it was so small Couldn t walk around the bed without hitting the radiator and could touch the bathroom sink from the bed Awful size to call it a bedroom definitely would not return caravan would be bigger |Positive:  Location only
Negative:  scaffolding outside the whole building I paid for a surprise visit for my father and was shocked to see the exterior without even being told Booked a twin deluxe room wasn t even suitable for a deluxe single room bathroom couldn t move bath toilet washbasin all squashed into a tiny room when the door opened it hit the bed Couldnt even sit at dressing table to dry hair Had to go to reception to ask for more coffee and milk sachets really poor Going to book breakfast but room was being refurbished although another area available The Hotel had a bit of history but sadly my visit will remain history it was really poor |Positive:  nothing
Negative:  See above |Positive:  They gave us complimentary wine and chops for husbands birthday but hotel dark dreary and building works at front of building and bar shuts at 23 00 hours
Negative:  Bed was too soft |Positive:  Location staff friendliness beautiful architecture of building inside Room a little bit small not that we spent too much time in there 
Negative:  Price is bit high for the size of the room per say BUT considering its located in only 10 minutes from Oxford Street and its right next to Hyde park its quite nice pricing They should have resupplied water on the second day as well No fridge available in the room No slippers provided Breakfast had to be booked and paid separately and rather pricey for a regular hotel buffet and does not offer an omelet they do offer fried eggs Breakfast was bit salty but that is just typical English style and it is rather subjective matter  |Positive:  The location is exceptionally good You can rule out every cons just with the location Only 10 15 minutes away from Oxford Street which is the main shopping area in London The place is very nice and calm The hotel provide with Here mobile device that you can carry it around the city with you in which it provides unlimited data and local calls with many information about I could take it around the city and search the web including the map Very clean traditional style hotel Very warm nice staffs that speaks different languages We could keep our luggage behind the desk for free of charge until we get back to take off to airport 
Negative:  Tried to have a bath one of the evenings I m pregnant and would have loved a hot bath after a long day but no hot water pretty disappointing  |Positive:  Room was compact but very comfortable and quiet Staff friendly and close to great transport into centre 
Negative:  The room while clean and updated was very small I know that is not unusual in London but we were disappointed at that price point It was difficult to get out of the bed on one side as it was almost to the wall and no room for luggage to be left out and open That s really our only complaint Hotel has an interesting history and was fine for our needs  |Positive:  Good location especially for access to Paddington Station for the Heathrow Express Also a short walk to Notting Hill and Portobello Road The night staff are lots of fun and provide great service Angels overnight Julian Carlos Claudio Agnelo It being close to Halloween Count Dracula was roaming the lobby and bar Our initial room smelled of cigarette smoke in spite of it being a non smoking hotel Thankfully they changed our room with no issue We had reserved a club room and were pleased to find a box of chocolates in addition to the wine and fruit bowl 
Negative:  The stairs the poky room with more steps immediately inside to the sleeping area making entry with bags very difficult Small bathroom and lack of ventilation and a rock hard bed  |Positive:  The old world look of the interior and the Opera Bar 
Negative:  EXTREMELY small rooms Look nothing like the picture If you take the lowest category you won t have any space left for your luggages Some of the staff were rude Other really nice No standards  |Positive:  Convenient location 
Negative:  Big queues so took a long time to check in Room was on the sub level so couldn t get a phone signal  |Positive:  Central clean good shower and bathroom comfy bed and just what I needed 
Negative:  Rooms are tiny with little space to move or place luggage Bathroom was the tiniest I have ever seen  |Positive:  Hotel staff are very professional but nothing is too much trouble Very attentive 
Negative:  Hotel has a number of sister sites nearby they tried to get me to move to a cheaper hotel because there was an issue When I said I reserved the right to come back and cancel without penalty if I did not like the new one They remarkably found a room for me in the original hotel  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The location was not 1 2miles from the venue I was attending There was scaffolding covering the front entrance The road was shared with several hostel type buildings They let a colleague check into my room without ID and no reference to her name on my booking good job she wasn t a stalker  |Positive:  The room was clean and the bathroom was quite new
Negative:  Some interesting characters at the adjacent hotels and apartments hanging outside in the evening Perhaps that s our fault for being outdoors after dark  |Positive:  Rich old wooden floors and moldings but fresh cleanly decorated rooms Tiny of course Delightful breakfast for just 12 pounds Just a block to Kensington gardens and Hyde Park Restaurants all up and down within walking distance A 5 10 cab fare to most anywhere but we used the tube over two days and got around just fine 
Negative:  we stayed when renovation work going on so shrouded in scaffold shame because it s a wonderful building Drawing room as in brochure being used as dining room so sitting area is in the entrance hall or bar  |Positive:  wonderful building great location excellent staff 
Negative:  The twin room we shared was extremely small Would have been suitable for single room There was no way the room temperature could be controlled in the evening when the central heating was turned on The staff provided a fan to cool the room until morning when the room air con was activated |Positive:  The Hotel was extremely interesting The d cor was beautiful with decorative stained glass windows and beautiful timber interiors The staff were helpful and friendly
Negative:  Can t think of anything to complain about  |Positive:  Staff were really helpful and friendly Ever such good value for money Top tip would be book direct as same price only breakfast is included although they upgraded us to free breakfast Rooms small but clean and comfortable 
Negative:  The 1st room we booked was nothing like the picture despite ringing booking com and confirming that also upgrading the room through them Also getting to the hotel we paid a extra 100 for a family room upgrade which was ok so on the whole the room costed us 460 for a family room which was absolutely ridiculous as we could ve stayed in Mayfair for that price plus it was our anniversary weekend and wasn t pleasant at all will not be going back there again or booking with booking Com and either  |Positive:  The fact that the manger gave some money back as a good will gesture
Negative:  Disabled access really needs improving  |Positive:  Great location and such a beautiful interior The historic connection added to the glamour too Fabulous restaurants nearby and excellent transport links 
Negative:  The building work outside our room was quite noisy which disrupted our mornings The rooms slightly too small |Positive:  Location of the hotel was Central The staff were very friendly and helpful Hotel is clean and comfortable Very welcoming atmosphere 
Negative:  I had booked online and was informed I could pay at the property The hotel debited my account on the Friday prior to my stay on the Sunday which I wasn t overly concerned with as I had no plans to cancel On checking in they asked for the balance of the room I explained that the money had already been debited from account and I was told that it was just to hold the room and I would need to pay again So in theory I have paid twice for the room I have been assured that the holding amount will be credited back to my account within 7 days But this not very good practice and would put me off booking an overnight break with this hotel again  |Positive:  The rooms were nice and clean but very small 
Negative:  6 stairs straighr down into the room from the door If you have stair issues be sure to mention this when you book  |Positive:  Beautiful building and charming staff Excellent breakfast 
Negative:  Rooms are very old fashioned and small Bathroom is small too with an old and not a particularly practical layout i e glass shower screen was too small and as a result the floor was covered in water after using the shower  |Positive:  The location
Negative:  We got stuck in the lift twice which was quite frightening The bed we had needed replacing as the springs had collapsed The power points lost power one morning therefore unable to use hairdryer or recharge devices I think it should noted on the website that scaffolding across the front of the building could raise concerns of noise and inconvenience |Positive:  Location and proximity to tube and park
Negative:  The account of my colleague who reported that there was a rat in one of the rooms The lift didn t work properly There was building work going on everywhere The place was dusty  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  The rooms could have been bigger The first room I was offered was very small more like a storage room insulting and really disappointing |Positive:  Breakfast and toilet were very good Housekeeping staff could do better job
Negative:  Fridge and air con didn t work We only realised as we were leaving so it s possibly fixed now No good coffee shops close |Positive:  The service was faultless 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Staff extremely helpful friendly and professional Facilities very good Rooms somewhat small but modern and very clean Photos a little misleading all looks larger in the photos Very good value for money 
Negative:  The room is extremly small and i found insects in the room and the reception  |Positive:  I liked the reception and the location The stuff were nice and the house keeping was very good 
Negative:  Room was way too hot and couldn t adjust temperature because window fused shut  |Positive:  Location was excellent Close to the Undrground easy walking to shopping district Great bar and snack facilities Staff excellent 
Negative:  Rooms were really small which was fine for one person but I would find sharing a deluxe with another person really difficult There s no restaurant for dinner and after getting off a long haul flight it would have been nice to sit inside the hotel instead of wondering queensway  |Positive:  The location was amazing and super central to everything The cleanliness was fab and the staff were really nice 
Negative:  They claimed they had a boiler problem and hence could not honour the booking They said they will provide rooms at another hotel which was their sister concern also called Grand Royale and equally good but sent us off to Shaftesbury Hotel where we were asked to share one room for three persons for the first night The second night we were transferred to two rooms but they were so tiny we could not even open our suitcases plus there were awkward steps to get in and out of the room That hotel did not even have a restaurant except for breakfast After much complaining we were given a better room but nowhere near the rooms shown for the Grand Royale It appears that the Grand Royale London Hyde Park is used to attract bookings on booking sites and then people are sent off to a much lower standard hotel In my opinion they are confidence tricksters One guest had evened called the police when we were there in the lobby for the same reason The hotel was not shut as other guests were given and stayed in rooms Since I was with family and had a lot of luggage we had to lump it as it was already night They killed the joy and ruined our holiday  |Positive: No Positive
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  It is a beautiful hotel full of old charm and character Beds comfortable showers hot wifi works well plus you receive a complimentary Handy phone to use during your stay This can be taken with you around London and can be used for Internet and local calls for free Hotel vey close to underground stations and plenty of restaurants and shops around the corner on Queensway to grab a bite to eat Would highly recommend this Hotel

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Being from australia we wanted a nineteenth century experience in a beautiful authentic olde world hotel It was all that The Lily Langtry theatre bar was outstandingly beautiful We had many gorgeous cocktails there amid the gilt and finery Loved it Although single rooms are small they are just enough and very comfortable The deep British bath was fabulous too 
Negative:  We were given a tiny room where we could hardly move and tiny bed for two pearls we asked to be changed and we were given one slightly bigger but next to the breakfast room very noisy even at 6am besides the door of the bathrooom was sticky and I told them but never cleaned it The bathroom was like a box where one could hardly move inside and the shower as well they wouldn t make reservations for the opera and if you call a taxi there they send you cars with their own prices which were a rip off  |Positive:  Free bottle of water and coffee and tea Location and reception
Negative:  Room very small Hotel overcharged significantly on sterling exchange rate and booking site kept giving diffetent excuses but never solved it  |Positive:  Hotel was very modern and clean Staff very polite and helpful Great location

Negative:  The door into the room would not open fully because of the wardrobe The bedrooms were tiny one side of the bed was only 25cm away from the wall and a radiator was stuck out from that leaving 16cm up the side of the bed We had asked for larger rooms and they tried to charge us extra for this I refused to pay any extra as I couldn t beleive there were any smaller rooms  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Bed was very uncomfortable fridge didnt get cold Wasn t really worth the money spent Would stay somewhere else next time  |Positive:  Very close to the bayswater and queenbridge underground

Negative:  We waited 35 minutes to start the checking in process while the two out of their depth receptionists struggled with a handful of guests Despite the fact that we arrived late in the afternoon owing to a broken down train our room wasn t ready The guests lounge seemed to be permanently closed The employment of a concierge would have improved matters greatly  |Positive:  Excellent location next to Kensington Gardens and a beautiful old building Buffet breakfast was good and staff efficient When we had a problem with our room they upgraded us without our even having to ask The room and bathroom were very pleasant and all the staff were nice

Negative:  Room service menu doesn t offer much and luggage took forever to be located after I had stored it on check out since I had an evening flight Otherwise a great hotel more like home because of the warm reception  |Positive:  Location is great 
Negative:  When we arrive after a long day we were told that I had booked two rooms which was incorrect there was only myself and me sister in law so we only needed one room We informed we would have to pay for both rooms until I spoke with an operator at your office and the hotel finally decided to cancel the extra room but for about an hour we were very worried that we had to pay for two rooms But got sorted in the end Also no airport shuttle so should say so on ads  |Positive:  Hotel was absolutely beautiful comfy bed and very pleased to have a bath in room Service was fantastic Location was amazing just near Kensington Palace and tube station 2 minutes away Very happy with location and service will certainly book again Luxury at the end of our trip before heading home

Negative:  book the club room which didn t feel like one The first room they gave us was on the second floor behind another random door which held 2 separate rooms The room was not well furnished despite the price paid One side of the mattress has collapsed I called the front desk several times and it was always un answered i went to the reception where they are awfully understaff and waited for a good long 15mins before I could address the change of my room I was told that it was the last room and I can t make any changes I was told to go for my dinner and come back again to see if they could do a swap When I came back they offered me another club room down in the basement with a window facing a neon bright light shinning right into the room every single night Thank god for the curtains The room was much smaller than the previous and reek of a mixture of dampness and new paint I was too tired and upset to even request for another room change  |Positive:  the staff which helped us changed our room and offered water when he saw that we were worn out from the change of room and the extreme long wait at the reception 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Cozy Botique Hotel Clean Rooms Excellent location with easy access to Tube Queensway station and Bayswater District Line Also very close to Kensington Park which is worth a visit Exceptional service levels Very helpful staff with smile on their faces Helped me in booking a luxury cab till airport at very reasonable price The team has accommodated my request for an early check in by couple of hours Super speed WiFi I will surely stay back in this hotel and would strongly recommend for a comfortabl stay and pocket friendly prices Booked a club size room and I must say it was a very decent size considering London room size standards Loved overall experience Keep up the good work team

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The courtesy shown by the team at the hotel for changing my room immediately as there was some problem with the wash basin and hence they gave us a better room

Negative:  Rooms very small having to pay in advance made you feel like they didn t trust you also the fact that no one told us at check in that we had to pay in advance resulted in an embarrassing position when we were locked out of our room On asking reception why we could not get in our room we were told in front of a busy reception area that it was because we hadn t paid I would expect to pay in a YHA but not in a hotel of this standard Ii have stayed in many hotels around the world and never have I had to pay in advance  |Positive:  The building

Negative:  As the no disturbe ight was on at the room door they STILL called me in the middle of the morning to offer room cleaning EVERY MONDAY MORNING or so they said the hotel has a FIRE DRILL Advanced warning could have been great so guests are not scared to death when it happens and nobody answers the phone at the reception  |Positive:  Staff and location The lobby looks great The hotel has elevator and air conditioning

Negative:  The bedrooms are very small and the staff are too courteous LoL  |Positive:  The bed was clean very comfortable and a big king size the bathroom was clean perfect I ve stayed many times in different Hotels in London some are bloody noisy in the morning with rubbish trucks or noisy kitchens below this Hotel was OK Great location for the City busses and the Tube Remember if you are over 65 bring your bus pass from home I m from Liverpool we could use ours for free bus trips after 9 30am

Negative:  The presentation of the hotel is quite dark and dower the family rooms leave a lot to be desired saying it is small is a little bit of an understatement and also the room was very tired and needs total redecoration  |Positive:  The hotel was conveniently located close to a main tube and good car park so we were able to avoid the congestion charge and not have too far to walk for the hotel

Negative:  To be honest our stay was a nightmare from start to finish We arrived at the hotel to be told that someone had been trying to contact us they hadn t and that we were being moved to a cheaper different hotel when we had picked this one due to its beauty My husband had to complain that we were still being charged the original price and being moved to a cheaper room so we were upgraded but the staff kept changing their mind about where we were going to be staying first telling us to move then that we were staying then again that we were moving We had to complain to get upgraded to a suitable room in the other hotel and the staff were disorganised and slow I am hugely disappointed as this was our wedding anniversary  |Positive:  The building is very beautiful

Negative:  There was a slightly bad smell in the second room We didn t say anything as we were not in the room very much and were so glad to have the bigger room  |Positive:  Staff was friendly When my sister in law and I found our twin room too tiny to move around in they accommodated us and gave us a bigger room after the first night Our favorite part was the hot chocolate in the room and this electric tea pot that boiled water amazingly fast Loved the free wifi too The hotel s location was close to subway stations too which was very nice 
Negative:  Incredibly small room So much so that we were a a couple with two medium size suitcases between us and it was too tight to have both on a stand each and the two of us bending over repacking without bumping into one another Can t swing a cat Or pack a suitcase |Positive:  Lovely decor downstairs The theatre bar was quaint to

Negative:  Needs a smartening up of its appearance But then it s in Bayswater not Mayfair  |Positive:  The photos in booking com give the impression of a delightful old hotel It isn t It s a bit down at heel in need of refurbishment The dark wood panelling in the reception area is a little gloomy and depressing Not a bright start The room was tiny although clean and comfortable Small but immaculately clean bathroom with a low pressure shower You don t really get a lot for your money here

Negative:  There was some issue at the hotel and on our first night we had to sleep in a partner hotel of theirs Though the quality was good the atmosphere of the room and breakfast area were not on par and we did not enjoy it that much We did return to our original hotel for the second night and were happier there  |Positive:  The rooms were clean Breakfast was a great variety and staff were very friendly

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Interesting hotel with a history of it having being a wealthy occupancy over the past decades The lovely unaltered appearance of Victorian era as approaching the entrance and within to the reception area door staff to welcome you in politely and with its own mini private theatre now a small busy and comfortable bar but retaining the unchanged decor of that period We had a small bedroom but clean and as we were only sleeping it was adequate Staff were very polite helpful and as we observed very patient Good position with tube station very close Queensway Hyde Park opposite which is always a lovely walk through for Landmarks ie Kensington Palace Serpentine Diana memorial water feature Nearby restaurants with many tastes catered for Good choice in London

Negative:  The room was supposed to be a Superior Double room it wasn t at all The window wouldn t open properly and we complained they wanted to give us another romm but as we had so Little time there we didn t want to move as our days were planned You could hardly walk next to hat ebed to get to the window or get into bed For this price not including breakfast the Hotel was very unsatisfactory A terrible cheek I would definitely want some money back I would never go to this Hotel again they are cheats  |Positive:  The breafast was very good and the personal there were also very good They cater for people eating gluten free So that was good I wrote and asked them about this per e mail but got NO Reply

Negative:  For the price of 168 for one night to be told that this did not include breakfast was shocking although when I complained the manager did allow us to have breakfast Also the photos of a Superior double room on the website did not live up to the reality of a very small drab room where there was barely enough room to walk around the bed There is more room and comfort in a budget hotel than this and as it was a birthday treat for my daughter we were very disappointed We won t ever come here again and it was not worth the money I will go with the budget option next time  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Sent to Park Grand Paddington Hotel Room was very small No cupboard space No fridge No iron Bed made in the am but bathroom not cleaned or towels changed No mini bar Very very disappointed Not given a discount considering we paid almost double to stay at the Grand Royale Hype Park compared to the hotel we were sent too for 2 nights  |Positive:  Really were looking forward to staying at this hotel told boiler had broken and sent to another hotel Park Grand Paddington Hote no character or history

Negative:  The so called Superior Double Room that was booked turned out to be the smallest room we have ever stayed in for a hotel which was not satisfactory for the price we paid although on the door it stated Club Room and not a superior room Also we checked in at 11 00 hr and returned at 23 15 hr to be told that there was a minimum of a 1 hour wait for our baggage to be taken to our room when they had all day to do this knowing what our room number was once cleaned and available We also once in the room and the hour was up had to call reception twice to find out when our bags would be delivered  |Positive:  Nothing to shout out about

Negative:  The staff never smiled and only ever said 3 words to me the whole time I was there I also got a poor view of their ventilation system For the money I paid I did not deserve a view of their ventilation  |Positive:  It was a very pretty place and just right around the corner from a beautiful park and easy to hop on the Underground to get to places

Negative:  The room 704 was very small for a double The bed was barely a double and there was hardly any space around the bed There was a very shallow single wardrobe which was of little use The bathroom sink was so impractical that water went everywhere when you tried to use it This should not be classed as a 4 star hotel in my opinion The Reception staff seemed more interested in having a good time than in helping guests  |Positive:  The Reception area was quite attractive

Negative:  Had to change rooms due to being put in what almost seemed like a cupboard with no window and no room for our luggage being six months pregnant this wasn t acceptable as the room was very stuffy so we asked to change rooms new room was more spacious with a window but did have dirty marks on wall and very hard bed which was uncomfortable  |Positive:  Staff very friendly and attentive bathroom lovely Tea and coffee facilities topped up every day and fruit provided Good location just round the corner from the tube

Negative:  On the day we were to check in I missed a call at 11am letting me know that due to a boiler issue our booking would be transferred to a sister hotel in Paddington for our entire stay Having googled this boiler issue I found that many other previous guests had the same experience noting that in their experience this was in fact an overbooking issue rather than any boiler Upon arrival at the hotel I was told that a taxi would be called for us and we could check in at the sister hotel I asked if there was a member of management I could speak to about this matter I expressed my dissatisfaction and how the substitute hotel was not somewhere that I had chosen to stay I also cited the many booking com reviews about this boiler that I had found I was told that this was just something that happened to the 2 hotel boilers please note that guests were both checking in and out during this time After causing quite a fuss at reception the hotel found us a room in the hotel one would imagine that this would have been done in the first instance rather than relocating a guest However I was happy that my original booking had then been honoured  |Positive:  Location was great with easy transport links

Negative:  Well given it wasn t the hotel I booked I can t really say much about it despite having booked 14 days earlier and despite the hotel looking pretty busy I was shifted hotels because of a supposed boiler fault Not being a tourist and staying all too regularly in London hotels I realise this is code for we ve overbooked the nicer hotel and shunt guests to the quieter hotel round the corner after we ve filled all the rooms It happens too often for me just to be an unlucky traveller 180 for the room breakfast on top and a room that to be fair was tidy but certainly not comparable with other similarly rated hotels that I stay in  |Positive:  Well it looked nice in reception but as I saw no more of it I ll have to take your word for how good it was

Negative:  Upon arrival tried to shift our booking across to a sister hotel in Paddington no explanation why but we refused Given our triple deluxe room which was really poor Cramped room was tatty and looked onto a square concrete storage area full of drinking water containers Manager offered concessions in an attempt to satisfy Hotel is grand but room we experienced was 2 star  |Positive:  Lovely looking hotel just a stones throw away from Hyde Park and Queensway tube station Friendly staff excellent breakfast Staff tried hardest to rectify issues see below

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Julian at the front desk was magnificent in helping me to book for an additional night when I was under pressure A real ambassador for the hotel and the company

Negative:  Staff were friendlier this time than last but a smile would still make all the difference Just do some basic staff training in courtesy and friendliness  |Positive:  Great bar and residents lounge unique Smart small modern rooms but no smaller than is the norm for this quality of hotel in London It IS London that most expensive of cities in a tiny country where living space is at a premium

Negative:  The bathroom was small though and a large person would have had very little space in the shower  |Positive:  We stayed for 2 nights at the beginning of the Easter break and the Grand Royale Hotel was in a good location It was easy to jump on the Tube Line and Buses which were a few minutes away We stayed in a Club Room which was comfortable and clean

Negative:  The only thing I would say is the room was very small really not what I expected for a club double Could have have also done with a little decoration in places Might be a good idea to put on the website that the rooms are small One other small thing was that there were complimentary drinks in the fridge but no bottle opener to open them with |Positive:  The hotel is a beautiful old building and the staff were extremely helpful couldn t do enough for you and very polite The breakfast was fantastic just about anything you could possibly want The room was clean and tidy 
Negative:  Tiny rooms and unfortunately I had an unpleasant case with staff on reception My friend left for me a handbag on reception at evening and receptionist promised her to bring it to my number Next day in the morning they ensured me that there was nothing for me left So after spending 20 minutes with all of members on reception they finally found my bag it was directly on the table in front of them I didnt expect that this could happen in London  |Positive:  Very beautiful interior in lobby perfect location for those who love Hyde park Close to 2 tube stations and city center

Negative:  The location is good the building lay out is very nice most of staff are v nice friendly The room was so basic in facilities like tea coffee shower gel body cream which was none The towels bed sheets smell really bad to the extent that I develop skin rashes the mattress pilows were uncomfortable  |Positive:  The location lay out staff 
Negative:  I booked a club room which in itself was fine along with the little extras but the bathroom The sink was so small Why bother When I leant over to try and brush my teeth and rinse my face the stupidly placed glass shelf above stopped me What idiot designed that Love the hotel but paying for a club room and getting a bathroom cupboard is just not acceptable The bathroom could have been made 1 2 metre wider and had a decent wash basin Puts me off staying again |Positive:  Staff location facilities
Negative:  Old style windows were in a fixed position they could not be opened or closed Gaps in the window frames allowed noise from the street to be heard clearly in the room at day and at night Draughts could also be felt coming through the windows The hotel restaurant was only used for breakfast only rather expensive room service was available at other times of the day Handy to have lots of stores and restaurants in the next street so you can pop out and get food for yourself  |Positive:  I liked the charm of the traditional styled reception areas Our room was furnished in a modern style and it was clean The location of the hotel was great for tube stations Bayswater and Queensway are really close by Attractions like Kensington Palace Hyde Park and the Royal Albert Hall were also really close too There is a good selection of restaurants close by for dining out 
Negative:  Having a laugh to describe the room as a deluxe double Open door and immediately faced with a flight of stairs up to the bed area which you had to negotiate separately as no room to swing a cat Bathroom equipment ok but pokey for a deluxe  |Positive:  Friendly helpful staff
Negative:  Working desk space in room not really usable because to small  |Positive:  Very stylish location and very nice breakfast buffet for the price Rooms fairly small but nicely done and without functional errors 
Negative:  the size of the room of course we re in London and I ve slept even in smaller rooms but still I can t help but find it extremely annoying can t really have space for the suitcase no minibar and the desk is really impossible to use without feeling contrained There was a nasty damp smell in the room The windows are rather old ok so s the building but the draft coming from outside was not pleasant thankfully the heavy curtains helped  |Positive:  great position few minutes walk from the tube good breakfast buffet comfortable bed but I was on my own I guess this was a double bed in which case it guess it can only house a tiny couple 
Negative:  A little cold at night because I did not find the air conditioning regulator until the morning My own fault but the print is small  |Positive:  Spacious suite and ample bath swift repair of faulty TV excellent breakfast
Negative:  Breakfast was quite expensive  |Positive:  Location was great queensway underground station was 2 minutes away Staff at the frontdesk was extremly kind and helpfull Rooms were small but has everything you need 
Negative:  Instructions to switch on the heating air con could be improved and be made more readily available alongside the other hotel information in the room  |Positive:  The hotel room was clean warm and very comfortable and the breakfast was more than plentiful The room itself wasn t the largest of hotel rooms I have stayed in however the comfort of the room and having a great nights sleep more than made up for the lack of space I found the staff to be exceptionally helpful from the point of my arrival and throughout the stay At checkout time the staff were politely informed that I could leave my luggage in a secure room whilst I went off to do some shopping before my actual departure time from London which was most appreciated Overall I had an enjoyable stay at the Grand Royale London Park Hotel and would certainly consider staying again on future visits to London 
Negative:  1 No refrigerator in the room had to keep some food I bought with the receptionist 2 The lower ground floor room was noisy because of poor insulation I could hear people who were walking on the pavement 3 No shower curtains 4 Very small room  |Positive: No Positive

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Access to Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park was only steps away and was the Underground and trains to Bond Street and Oxford Circus Also it was an easy walk to Notting Hill Gate Quite and comfortable room and bed 
Negative:  Tiny room with no view but at least they made an effort at cheerfulness by placing flowers in the windows that you look out at  |Positive:  Smiling staff couldn t do more to help Quirky atmosphere Love the Victorian entrance 
Negative:  There seemed to be huge communication difficulties We asked at booking for two twin rooms or if that was not possible then two single duvets on each double bed Acquiring the single duvets seemed to be the most difficult thing in the world to achieve I lost count of how many attempts it took but it included getting two extra double duvets for each room various doubles and singles and eventually two singles arrived with two duvet covers to put on ourselves not good except they weren t duvet covers they were sheets Two covers were subsequently requested and arrived given to us to put on ourselves except one was a double By this time it was about 12 30am The receptionist was profusely apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast At breakfast we asked for 1 coffee 2 teas and 1 fruit tea We got 1 coffee and two fruit teas When I pointed out the mistake we were brought 1 more tea At this point we gave up and my daughter and I shared the tea When we were leaving my daughter phoned reception and asked if they could book a taxi to take us to the station but when we arrived downstairs the receptionist said she d forgotten to do it Not good we very nearly missed the train All in all it was quite tiresome  |Positive:  Location was lovely the building was beautiful the staff were very friendly polite and helpful 
Negative:  The rooms were small and very tired All needs refurbishment My initial room was so tiny and required going up a few stairs to get to the bed The quilt was too small for the bed and I could hear people talking Asked to change rooms and was given a better room slightly larger which was appreciated Have stayed in better hotels in London for less  |Positive:  A good size bath Close to Hyde Park and train station

Negative:  Nothing could have been better |Positive:  The attention to detail provided by the staff at all levels The courtesy they offer where nothing is too much trouble for them The comfort of the beds and the provision of slippers and towelling robes denotes real quality The room rates are excellent for such good service in a central London location We always choose this hotel when coming to London because it cannot be bettered 
Negative:  The bathroom was small so if you are some over 6 foot just be aware there is not much room for you  |Positive:  The location is amazing Next to Hyde park and the tube stop is very easy to get to This is definitely the one of the better hotels for it s price 
Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Selected the hotel for the location and the photos but has been re located to a near by hotel from the same group At first disappointed but Grand Roal Paddington turned out to be a perfect one 
Negative:  The offers did not include breakfast You would rather buy a full package This was an unexpected surprise  |Positive:  Location Good facilities Good location Near the subway Good neighborhood Located next to a nice park

Negative:  The bedroom was really cold and had single glazing Apparently we could ve turned the radiators on using the air conditioning That wasn t explained to us and there was no welcome pack in the room Our room was at the front of the hotel and I had a disturbed night s sleep from a lot of noise in the street Also breakfast was so expensive we didn t choose it Finally we chose the delux room supposed to be the bigger option but it was tiny The bedroom door couldn t even open fully  |Positive:  The location was good the bed was comfortable 
Negative:  Size of room was small even when I was upgraded rooms due to maintainence issues Size of bathroom also very small Hotel lobby very dark due to original dark wood walls Requires more lighting  |Positive:  Nice firm mattress Room decor was okay Bathroom was modern

Negative:  What they call a superior double room is a BOX room I wouldn t recommend staying there if you want a couple of days Also it seems when you arrive reception fill you with a sob story that 38 rooms are out of order so the booking has to be amended even though no prior warning is given via a courtesy call or email they recommend moving you to a sister hotel down the room We put up a bit of a fight saying we didnt want to move and wanted what we booked which ended up being a box room As we were walking away they seem to use this trick on another couple who arirved shortly after claiming there were no rooms for them seems to me they want you to book that specific hotel and when you arrive give you some sob story about the rooms being out of order How many other people have they tried this on It s value for money if you re not messed around  |Positive:  Nice communal areas Staff pleasant 
Negative:  Welcome at Reception wasn t great Room very small would like to know what the standard doubles are like however was ok for 2 nights Bathtube needs bigger screen No mini fridge |Positive:  Gorgeous Building Great Links with 2 Tube stations on different lines Good Quality Value Breakfast Selection of places to eat nearby Bag hold gave us another full day in London before our Train at 7pm 12pm check out Love a lay in

Negative:  the rooms are far too small for a couple I have asked to have a larger room and the staff accomodated me but the improvement was minimal in the new room  |Positive:  staff was extremely kind and the breakfast was good the price of the room was quite below London average special offer 
Negative:  The only real issue for us was the mattress which could have been firmer for more comfort  |Positive:  The breakfast choice was wonderful and if you book before the day its only 12 per head The hotel is very close to a tube station on the central line making transport to various locations ideal 
Negative:  Room was upgraded to a basement room that wasn t much larger than bed I d hate to have seen my booked room Later discovered that the original person who was to stay in that room complained and was given OUR room We were tripping over ourselves No room for our cases Room smelled of smoke for over a day Staff was very aloof Hade to ask for the iron board and it didn t come the first day  |Positive:  Location close to tube Paddington Bed was comfortable

Negative:  On arrival we were told we were upgraded to a club room which according to the receptionist was one of their largest rooms When we got to our room is was very small We had barely enough room to walk around the bed We had booked a superior room so I d hate to think how small this would have been Having said that it was very clean and comfortable  |Positive:  Location was perfect very close to everything and staff were very friendly Hotel itself is well maintained and clean with a lovely bar however when we were there it was very empty

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  Staff couldn t do enough The Hotel felt like a home and the breakfast was superb The location was perfect and the stay was best value I have ever had

Negative:  While the room was moderately comfortable it was very small and lacked finesse The sheets didn t fit the bed the shower head did not appear to work properly and the bathroom door wouldn t close These were small inconveniences but for the cost of the room I would not have expected them  |Positive:  The staff were friendly and helpful and the location made it very easy to travel around London 
Negative:  The hotel staff made a mistake on the date of my Heathrow shuttle booking which did not arrive on my check out date It was only after I waited for 40mins and asked the hotel staff to call the shuttle company before they realized the mistake I had to make last minute alternative arrangements to Heathrow airport and was nearly late for my flight  |Positive:  Hotel architecture has a traditional English heritage charm which makes my stay feel authentic yet has modern facilities to ensure a pleasant stay Room is new and clean though small There s a welcome basket of fruits and chocolates in the room which are appreciated Hotel is conveniently located from Kensington Garden Queensway and Bayswater Underground 
Negative:  Broken thermastat Smell from drains told we would have a superior double room but it was standard apparently in this Hotel superior means standard Bedding inadequate no window no ventilation one sealed window that was dirty very small room  |Positive:  Location
Negative:  Room was terribly small and the bathroom was even smaller I think this is typical for most European hotels I am from the U S and accustomed to larger facilities but it was very small for two people Also we were in the basement meaning we had a terrible view and the one window we did have was drafty and leaked in wind all night long causing the person sleeping nearest the window to freeze  |Positive:  Loved the location Very close to two Underground lines and Hyde Park

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The room had been recently renovated in a modern style We found it very attractive but it might disappoint others if they were looking for the Victorian style of the public areas These were beautifully ornate with dark paneling and decorated ceilings The one way street was residential with large well maintained Victorian houses now mostly flats It was very quiet A range of local food shops and restaurants was within easy walking distance along with a Circle line underground station It was easy to travel to the theatre via the Circle line We had booked room only so cannot comment on the food 
Negative:  Their room prices were a bit steep Even that is fine but then it should include breakfast They didn t include the breakfast in the charge and it was 15 pounds per person which some might find expensive of one looks at the total amount spent  |Positive:  The hotel is very beautiful it has an amazing antique reception and hall The entire experience was great The staff was very helpful the hotel manager was very welcoming on the day we arrived as he wrote a special note welcoming us I loved that personal touch Yes central London is very expensive and the rooms aren t big But it s central London And when everything that one can possibly need is available without asking then nothing else matters The toilet even had a bath tub which was great A great experience And its just on the other side of the Queensway station a 2 min walk And has many restaurants and supermarkets in the vicinity which is an added advantage Totally worth it I recommend it strongly 
Negative:  The size of room is really small although they upgraded us to a club room which was at lower ground and even through the window we could not see the sky or anything else except a wall and an air condition fixed on it  |Positive:  Location of the hotel it s decoration and specially the staff were very good
Negative:  The cost of the smallest room we have ever had in London We asked at the end of the stay why our water was not replenished and was informed only the first day was included in the price unless you are a club member We believe that for in excess of 500 pounds for a 72 hour stay bottled water would be included The fruit was a nice touch but removed when left and not replaced it would of been nice to leave it for the following day The basis of this hotels prices seems to be the grand entrance as the remained of the hotel is a very dated  |Positive:  The location was very good

Negative:  the hotel looked much fancier on the photos than in reality the hallways were very narrow and claustrophobic the drain in the shower didnt work even after we warned the cleaning lady i got a discount meaning 280 pounds for two nights but this meant a room with a view of the opposite wall  |Positive:  the location was great near hyde park and at walkable distance from the center

Negative:  room 611 was small and compact you could hear upstairs rooms and outside road breakfast was good but both mornings we went at 9 30 and the bacon and sausage was cold there were about 4 staff but they were not watching when people want serving half the time slow service for this priced hotel its a little out of main hubbs taxis expensive but tube station just around corner which is good I am not moaning senior management need to train staff to be more pro active watch the food so it doesn t go cold and smile  |Positive:  the room service cleaning etc was good the hotel was clean bar staff good drinks expensive whiskey and coke and barcardi and coke was 15 70 well it is London I suppose reception staff good

Negative:  Very small room with no space at all so it is hard to move The room we stayed in had a very small window at the top which you could not even open so the room itself was a bit dark and stuffy It felt a like living in a basement Furthermore you can hear everything through the walls for example when guests in a room above you wake up you can hear their steps If your breakfast is not included in a room rate make sure you pro actively ask the reception for a cheaper pre booked option when checking in Otherwise you are not informed pay more for the same when just coming for a breakfast in the morning and may have unpleasant surprise when checking out and discovering it At that moment nothing can be done as it is in the system already  |Positive:  Nice location next to tube stations and Hyde Park Beautiful interior at the reception and breakfast area unfortunately the lobby was closed for a private event throughout our whole stay Nice breakfast with a good variety of food

Negative:  The room was really quite small but for 108 per night from wowcher it was worth it considering the location There was quite a bit of noise in the early hours as the room was at the back of the hotel and backed onto shops getting they re deliveries etc And the air con heating didn t work properly flashed on the wall until I covered it with a towel Also the sink plug wouldn t close for my partner to have a shave in There was no view as the window was frosted we didn t eat in hotel maybe next time |Positive:  The building was beautiful full of character it was clean and current
Negative:  Room just too small particularly if you have any luggage and who doesn t  |Positive:  This hotel did everything it could with the hand it was dealt The staff was very helpful and accommodating the room was well supplied reading lights and bedside tables on both sides nice bathroom with large towels window you could open fairly widely excellent free wi fi connection thoughtful tea tray tho we didn t use it The problem was that the room was so small we could not pass each other One had to hop on the bed for the other to walk around the room If you like to do calisthenics or yoga in your hotel room you will not be able to accomplish that in this room Also in staying 5 days we were in need of another bar of soap but it never was supplied

Negative:  Do not stay here I had a single room I didn t mind the small size of it however the bedroom AC only sent out hot air even though it was set at 17 degrees the plumbing in the bathroom made noise all night and there was a green light in the hallway ceiling that was too bright and lit up the room at night A really uncomfortable experience I got about 3 hours sleep  |Positive:  Nothing

Negative:  I thought the size of the room on arrival to be small disappointing misleading at time of booking The room didn t smell very clean I asked to be moved  |Positive:  The hotel is in a good location however I have stayed at much better hotels more centrally located 
Negative:  Against the positives the hotel has some clear minuses starting from the size of the rooms we had booked a double deluxe room and we found ourselves in a ridiculously minuscule room where two people can hardly move at the same time and the bathroom was at best 4sq m As a side note one of the two lifts has been permanently out of service which made the waiting time to go up and down unbearably long A final warning for future possible customers some of the rooms the hotel offers are in the basement if you are unlucky enough to be assigned one of those rooms when checking in watch out you don t want to be there  |Positive:  Overall this is a nice hotel with some plusses a beautifual old style entrance hall and bar and equivalent large rooms for breakfast the staff is efficient and very courteous the breakfast buffet is quite reach

Negative:  The only little complaint I have is you need to clean the bathroom doors more often Mine was sticky The rest of the room was very clean though  |Positive:  The bar is stunning Actually the whole hotel is beautiful 
Negative:  We were given two single beds pushed together rather than the double that we thought we had booked The room was a bit of a dungeon might suit some but for this couple it was not a happy outcome to a romantic evening  |Positive:  Good location and staff were delightful though ultimately unhelpful suggesting it would have been better if we had booked direct with them 
Negative:  despite booking this Hotel in January we were given rooms at top of hotel classed as Superior rooms They were more like attic rooms You could not walk around the small double bed However we were given complimentary breakfast  |Positive: No Positive

Negative:  We arrived at Royale Hotel at Hyde Park where they took my payment for the room It was only after they took my payment that they then told us that there was maintenance issues within the building so they would have to re locate us to another hotel in Paddington They paid for our taxi but told us the taxi would be with us in 5 mins however we were made to wait 30 mins before i had to again ask the staff how long it would be The hotel itself was really nice just the whole point of us having to be re located after i had already made payment was not acceptable  |Positive:  The hotel we ended up staying in was actually very nice even though it was in a different location to where we had booked it 
Negative:  Our room was nice but was a little cramped trying to walk around the bed the TV didn t have good reception  |Positive:  We thought the hotel was lovely and the staff were helpful and friendly

Negative:  Upon arrival there was one person at the desk who was on the phone which is understandable however after 5 minutes of not even any eye contact as acknowledgment and a mobile phone ringing constantly behind the desk as it was not switched on silent we were then greeted She told us our room was not ready so we could have a club room in the basement if we liked We did appreciate the upgrade from a double room but we still found it to be quite small When entering the room I immediately noticed the black marks all over the walls My partner then noticed a huge crack in the toilet seat I turned on the air con and dust visibly flew out so I ran my fingers over it and found that it indeed was covered in dust After informing the front desk and upon return to our room I was pleased to see the toilet seat was replaced and air con cleaned I decided to have a bath and noticed the plug was broken so in order to drain the water after my bath I had to annoyingly fiddle with it Then when flushing the toilet the actual button stuck and constantly flushed until I forced it to pull back out On my first night I had ordered and orange juice and glass of prosecco my orange juice which was visibly not being used anymore due to the water floating on top of it and the Orange juice sunken to the bottom was left and was still there when we were checking out I proceeded to write my comments in the leaflet provided After I finished writing I turned to the back of the leaflet and to top it off it was covered in some sort of sticky substance which just added to my frustration We looked at a range of hotels and chose yours as it is truly beautiful from the outside and seemed like somewhere we could enjoy staying at However we didn t even want to drink in the bar or relax in our room because we were that disappointed My partner was extremely unhappy too as this getaway was a gift for me Overall unfortunately this was not an enjoyable experience from start to finish  |Positive:  Entrance hall was beautiful
Negative:  I know it was in a deal but the room was very small It was at the end of the top floor corridor in the eaves  |Positive:  Location to Hyde Park and Tube stations was superb
Negative:  Do not order room service We ordered two panini s in the evening One Cheese Chicken and the other Cheese Pepperoni This was to come with a side salad and crisps This was a simple choice and we expected nothing fancy However when the dish arrived the panini was soggy and had also somehow been strewn over the plate the bottom of the panini stayed on one side the filling on the plate and the top of the panini had been squashed on the other side It looked as though a child had been playing with our food before it even arrived I took the food down to show the manager only to be told that that is how a panini should look I said I have eaten many panini s over the time and this is not how a panini should look the chef came and said oh I dont know how a panini should look I dont eat them This wasnt really the response I was hoping for So just to make you aware please dont order the room service you will be disappointed  |Positive: No Positive
Negative:  Room was a bit small and breakfast was a little pricey but still within comfortable standards  |Positive:  Beautiful property with a great history Location couldn t be better Very close to Hyde and Kensington Park Staff was helpful and prompt with request Breakfast room was STUNNING It was close to two tube stations so it was very accessible for travel I would definitely stay there again

Negative:  We were moved from Grand Royale to Shaftesbury International up the road I agreed because I was told the replacement was the same standard It wasn t We were upgraded to a Club Room which was tiny Hair on floor in bathroom and hair in towels Specks of dirt in bed some sort of ironing residue The hotel was next door to some sort of hostel with a rowdy group of drinking buddies outside  |Positive:  Staff were pleasant and helpful 
Negative:  Maybe I haven t got my head around London pricing yet but I couldn t understand why a glass of red wine and a bacardi coke in the Theater bar should cost considerably more than a breakfast We did get better value in bars located nearer the hotel  |Positive:  Staff were superb we didn t meet a bad person all week Lots of choice for breakfast the room was more than adequate for our needs if I m a bit picky a spruce up with a paint brush wouldn t have gone a miss and we loved the building The location was spot on for us too and would like to stay at this hotel for all of our London visits in the years to come Thank you 
Negative:  Deluxe Double Room is grossly misrepresented in the hotel s online advertising over a nine day stay my room was never cleaned properly and if luckily the bedding which was old and worn may have been changed 1 time On several occasions I saw the Front Desk Staff engage in quite unpleasant discussions with guests who arrived to find that their booking had to been honoured or those like myself who were very unhappy with the accommodation I was promised an upgrade to a Club Room after 1 night but the Front Desk never followed up on this  |Positive:  Yes the Lobby and Formal Drawing Room are quite stunning as is the Theatre but it all stops there
Negative:  Nothing negative to say but if I was forced to give something it would be that the pillows are hard and uncomfortable  |Positive:  The building and interior decor is beautiful and in keeping with its history 
Negative:  the room size is terrible small for us from ASIA to LONDON cant stay in this hotel because we cant even open one luggage No space to walk around and even place your products or hang your clothes the room is even smaller than JAPAN room I think winter period not advise for long haul flight to stay here do not have the space to place or even pack thing we need to hop around dam funny for us we are consider petite sizes and we need to hop around the room hahaha good work out for us this hotel is good for 3 days 2 nites short stay with one small bag  |Positive:  the location great for jogger that can jog at the park or different stations to different locations this is why l like this hotel one lady I think assistant manager or manager I like her she is helpful and great the bellboy group also helpful too share more than you ask that kind of answer you will receive request thing fast to deliver to us

Negative:  Difficult to get around the bed duvet too small lovely view of the bins from neighbouring shops |Positive:  Excellent location comfortable room enjoyable breakfast
Negative:  Decor is dreadfully bland and whole place feels soul less The reception and bar are particularly small and totally lacking in comfort not even enough chairs It is a beautiful old building but has been badly modernised and in no way is this a four star hotel APART from the great staff  |Positive:  Great bathroom very good breakfast and great location just 5 mins walk to Hyde Park Lancaster Gate tube station and a few nice pubs

Negative:  We were in room 026 Very noisy from 7am Doors banging constantly we could constantly hear the bleeping of a key pad followed by another door banging We had asked for a quiet room Also a small point re the wardrobe Hanging space not long enough for clothes perhaps one shelf should be taken out  |Positive:  Beautiful building staff very welcoming professional 
Negative:  Pricing of a single person 3 5x2 m room adjacent small shower was unreasonable I don t know how the picture of the bed was made It must have been made before they built the walls around the room Could not have been more than 50 cm between bed and wall on one side only Had to stack furniture on the cabinet to have access to bed from bathroom Unpractical cabinet to stow luggage while there was no room to leave it in the room  |Positive:  Lively neighborhood access to underground close to Hydepark for a run very pleasant hard working and well trained staff alert security service to keep a watch on a drunk guest Classic Grand hotel surroundings

Negative:  Room was a bit claustrophobic often seen in older UK properties Would appreciate a second chair so that both residents could sit simultaneously  |Positive:  We selected the location for easy access to amenities transportation etc but the elegance of the property made us look forward to returning home at the end of a hectic day

Negative: No Negative |Positive:  The hotel is well situated to get around the city I travelled alone and had a single room which was just fine for me Comfortable and clean a nice bar as well

Negative:  Nothing really  |Positive:  I liked the name of your hotel I liked the look of your hotel I liked eating breakfast in your hotel I liked all of your staff the quality of service care we received during our 6 night stay in your hotel Your hotel was grand enough for this Aussie Princess her bloke

Negative:  the room is not practical difficult to open the window stairs after the door to get in the room loss of space no cover on the bath so the water gets all around the bathroom hairdryer attached to drawer but not enough space to sit down on the chair am I supposed to steel the hairdryer there were small flies |Positive:  it was a clean room overall except from the small flies 
Negative:  I would have liked breakfast to have been included in our stay We were offered it at a reduced rate but it would have been easier if it was included in the initial price as an option  |Positive:  Everything basically The room was great the bed was comfortable the location was great and the staff we very welcoming and we particularly liked the Happy Hour in the Theatre Bar 
Negative:  Fire alarm kept going off plugs did not work one morning and staff did not know the jogging route mentioned in the hotel guest guide Rooms not serviced promptly and at our convenience |Positive:  The location and decor
Negative:  Upon arrival we had to wait 10 minutes in the rain before someone could help us bring our 7 suitcases up the stairs into the reception area We had booked and paid for two of the same rooms as we were a group of 4 people One of our rooms were a downgrade from the other the rooms did not have the same appliances and one room had less space than the other We asked to be moved so we could both have the same room type and they said yes but never got round to it We had to wait over an hour for some ice buckets We found a thick long transparent plastic string in one of plates of breakfast and the restaurant staff actually looked into my hair and told me it was my hair because nobody in the kitchen has that hair We accidentally dropped salmon on our bed sheets and it smelt really bad so we asked if we could have a new duvet They gave us an uncovered single duvet for our double bed so when we asked for a double the night porter gave us the same dirty salmon duvet that we had put on the floor outside the room When we confronted him about it he shouted you cannot expect us to clean the bedding everyday My card was overcharged by 264 when I had checked out When I rang the hotel to let them know they said it s not their fault it s my bank When I called my bank they had given me 2 preauth codes proving the hotel were holding an extra 264 from my card and they had to fax my bank to allow the to cancel it The manager was unable to use his own fax machine so he sent me the fax letter through email and he made it my duty to get it faxed to a bank They are highly unprofessional and I will never ever stay at this hotel again It is appauling and disgusting  |Positive:  After explaining to the manager all of the terrible things we experienced at this hotel We were given complimentary breakfast for bothh days and 20 refund although I believe our whole stay should ve been refunded 
Negative:  Size of the club room we were in Very small Luckily we travelled light  |Positive:  Nice hotel with mostly friendly staff Great location with fantastic access to Hyde park and Queensway tube 3 minutes walk away 
Negative:  Very small room quite a challenge with two suitcases  |Positive:  We were transferred to their sister hotel The Shaftsbury due to some problem with water supply to some of the rooms so this review is actually for that hotel We were given a very small room which had everything you needed and was clean and comfortable but it is just as well that we are smallish people and reasonably fit as the bed was right against the wall and one of us had to climb over the other to get in or out We were given free breakfast every day in compensation of the move which was greatly appreciated and the staff were all lovely The hotel is very close to both Bayswater and Queensway tube stations and to Hyde Park 
Negative:  Lots of ladies entering the hotel at random hours of the night and visiting various rooms I guess they must have been looking for something they lost  |Positive:  Not much

Negative:  Reception staff poor upon arrival 6 staff behind reception seemingly dealing with 1 unhappy guest whilst we stood there finally someone came to check us in He demanded full payment straight away which is fine then told us our room was not ready this was 3pm check in is 2pm not a good start  |Positive:  Location was excellent clean room 
Negative:  The rooms are very small I booked a deluxe double room which is supposed to be bigger than a superior double room but it is difficult to imagine a room smaller than the one I had There was not enough space to get out of one side of the double bed The fire alarm went off at 4am not the hotel s fault but the following night I was kept awake by faulty door chimes which I couldn t stop from flashing green and red it was like trying to sleep in a night club  |Positive:  The fire alarms seem to work Staff are pleasant and professional Building full of character

Negative:  The fire alarm went off at 4am It was chaos No one knew what to do Proper legal protocol was not followed Poor communication from the staff And not one word of an apology until we brought it up the next morning It spoilt out overnight stay The hotel could be fabulous Just staff and decor in some rooms let it down  |Positive:  The hotel in the main is stunning But the rooms need sorting We had a hole in the wall and it desperately needs fixing up My mum and stepdaughter got lots of complimentary things chocolates drinks etc we didn t

Negative:  Bathroom could have been a little larger showerscreen far too small  |Positive:  Very friendly helpful staff Ground floor kept in it s original style Good value breakfast 
Negative:  Deluxe double was a VERY small room could barely walk around the bed the ceilings were also low on 6th floor so when I was in shower I nearly hit my head on ceiling and I m only 5 foot 4 there were no special out of ordinary touches eg refrigeration guest robes iron or board in room there was a kettle and blow dryer it was clean however I would rate this a 3 star |Positive:  Lovely ornate lobby perfect safe location 1 block from underground The facade of building is what makes the building
Negative:  Read my comment above |Positive:  Rooms are too small from what updated in the online same like prison room entry disappointed with the service from morning desk as they are claiming the picture advertised is not under thier responsibility they don t give me option to cancel the booking at all I need to pay more pounds to upgrade the room but that room also with unreasonably limited space with higher paying rate Only satisfied with the service of night shift Manager and team Aijaz Aurel Charlie

Negative:  At first a staff gave me a room on first floor that i had to walk up many stairs and through a long corridor with my big heavy luggage Luckily another lady arranged a room on ground floor for me that made me feel more comfortable  |Positive:  Good location in a safe residential area The hotel offered subtle bus to Heathrow airport which helped me a lot because I traveled alone and was carrying a big luggage 
Negative:  Duvet too small for comfort told we could request for down pillows n bedding never came bed softer than most other places we ve stayed in london bed n bedding duvet pillows poor sub standard quality does not match to your hotel image Quite disappointing Bedroom though small is expected but configuration awkward opens bathroom door to block access to basin tight n squeezy even for one Really need to look into that  |Positive:  Staff n location great
Negative:  Rooms was very compact and didn t look four star which was a shame as the hotel itself was gorgeous and staff fantastic |Positive:  The style of hotel and location was fantastic

Negative:  The rooms are little small but i think for the money i paid I got the best value Good job Grand Royal hotel  |Positive:  Location customer service breakfast was served in very best room What ever i asked they were more then happy to help 
Negative:  On check in we was told we had to be relocated due to a maintenance issue The chap who dealt with this didn t do so in the best manner what upset us the most was the hotel option was not as good and cheaper than yours and when I said we will cancel and I would book elsewhere myself we was allowed to stay This ruined our start to our stay Marks on all bedroom walls and a toe nail clipping on bedroom Carpet small bedroom also  |Positive:  Great location fantastic breakfast of very high quality foods Theatre bar and original features are impressive 
Negative:  Very small rooms just fit a double bed with small staircase to the bathroom which was tiny I guess its because of the location which was excellent |Positive:  Very good location and also nice common rooms
Negative:  For the third time I was bumped out of the hotel upon arrival to another in the group The other hotel had a lift out of order the TV worked when the porter shook it and a large bathroom towel hook fell off the wall on my foot I am fed up with not being able to stay at the hotel I booked and I am meant to be on their partner frequent stay list What was worse while waiting for a taxi to go to other hotel they were booking other solo travellers in  |Positive:  I chose this because of location and I liked it 
Negative:  Despite being upgraded to club the room was tiny and the window opened to the staff entrance which was noisy and busy with people smoking I asked to email the manager but no email was sent to me with his contact details  |Positive:  A double superior room was booked and on arrival we where upgraded to club
Negative:  small rooms and expensive as far as quality and price is concerned |Positive:  Really nice location in the centre The staff was really helpfull and polite The rooms were clean

Negative:  However the rooms were compact and we were asked on arrival if we wanted to upgrade for free to a club room which was bigger than the room we had booked The club room turned out to be compact and the bath was tiny No view as it was on the lower ground floor Wouldn t stay here again  |Positive:  The hotel was good overall with a bus route straight to Piccadilly 
Negative:  We were transferred to a sister hotel as the boiler wasn t working The alternate hotel is advertised as 4 star I don t think this rating was gained via the normal national rating system as it doesn t come close to other 4 star rated hotels I have stayed in It does not meet the high standard expected of a 4 star The bedroom was small and cramped the room smelt and the bathroom was worn tattered unclean and the breakfast was average It was a real disappointment  |Positive:  All the staff where lovely and very helpful
Negative:  The rooms were a little on the small side but adequate Can t say anything negative as it has great location clean rooms and friendly and helpful staff  |Positive:  Value for money s The manager also left a personal welcome note for us in our room along with some little luxury items chocolates wine and soft drinks The children were delighted to have some goodies delivered room service too Excellent start to our holiday
